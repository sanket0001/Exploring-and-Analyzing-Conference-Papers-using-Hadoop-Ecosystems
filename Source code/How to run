//Readme file for Exploring and Analyzing Conference Papers Source code.


Link dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/nips-2015-papers

First convert all pdf files to text files by PDFConvert source code.
PDFConvert- this folder contains code for converting PDF files into text files

Data- this folder contains Input and hive data folder.

Input- this folder contains all papers text files.
First put it into HDFS by command-
hadoop fs -put input /user/training


Problem-1 - Finding similar papers

Here it' divided into two parts.First is to find the word and frequency by TF-IDF. And second is to find similar paper for sample paper.

WordFrequency- this folder contains source code for finding TF-IDF.
SortSimilar- this folder contains source code for finding similar papers.

How to run-
Part-1
Go to WordFrequency folder in terminal.
And then write command-
hadoop jar indexer1.jar index.WordFrequenceInDocument
{I have statically provided input and output path for everyone in the java file.}

After it completes running. Write another command-
hadoop jar indexer2.jar index.WordCountsInDocuments

And one other command for final tf-idf output-
hadoop jar indexer3.jar index.WordInCorpusTFIDF

Note- [I have tried to run it in sequential mapper-reducer but in last when finding tf-idf output it is creating error. But if i run separately like this shown above it works properly.]

Part-2
Go to SortSimilar folder in terminal.
And then write command-
hadoop jar sortsimilar.jar

It will give us output of similar papers and its frequency that how much is similarity between sample paper and that paper.


Problem-2 - Finding total number of paper published by country name.

Country- this folder contains source code for finding country counts.

How to run-

Go to Country folder in terminal.
And then run command-
hadoop jar country.jar

Problem-3 - Finding datasets 

Datasets- this folder contains source code for finding datasets and number of times its used in papers.

How to run-

Go to Datasets folder in terminal.
And then run command-
hadoop jar datasets.jar

Problem-4 - Finding top author's name for publishing more number of paper

this one is processes by hive.
Authors.csv and PaperAuthors.csv contains all data.

How to run-
First create table for both files using command-

CREATE TABLE Authors (Id int , Name string) row format delimited fields terminated by ',';



CREATE TABLE PaperAuthors (Id int , PaperId  int, AuthorId int ) row format delimited fields terminated by ',';



And then load data into it from csv files by command-



LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/training/Desktop/test/Authors.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE Authors;


LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/training/Desktop/test/PaperAuthors.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE PaperAuthors;


And run below query for our problem-

SELECT a.Name Author,
COUNT(a.Name) NumPapers
FROM Authors a
INNER JOIN PaperAuthors p ON p.AuthorId=a.Id
GROUP BY a.Name
ORDER BY NumPapers DESC;




Project snapshot- this folder contains snapshots of all commands run in terminal and its output.
