Abstract
This paper presents a Bayesian optimization method with exponential conver-
gence without the need of auxiliary optimization and without the δ-cover sam-
pling. Most Bayesian optimization methods require auxiliary optimization: an ad-
ditional non-convex global optimization problem, which can be time-consuming
and hard to implement in practice. Also, the existing Bayesian optimization
method with exponential convergence [1] requires access to the δ-cover sampling,
which was considered to be impractical [1, 2]. Our approach eliminates both re-
quirements and achieves an exponential convergence rate.
1 Introduction
We consider a general global optimization problem: maximize f(x) subject to x ∈ Ω ⊂ RD where
f : Ω → R is a non-convex black-box deterministic function. Such a problem arises in many real-
world applications, such as parameter tuning in machine learning [3], engineering design problems
[4], and model parameter fitting in biology [5]. For this problem, one performance measure of an
algorithm is the simple regret, rn, which is given by rn = supx∈Ω f(x) − f(x
+) where x+ is the
best input vector found by the algorithm. For brevity, we use the term “regret” to mean simple regret.
The general global optimization problem is known to be intractable if we make no further assump-
tions [6]. The simplest additional assumption to restore tractability is to assume the existence of a
bound on the slope of f . A well-known variant of this assumption is Lipschitz continuity with a
known Lipschitz constant, and many algorithms have been proposed in this setting [7, 8, 9]. These
algorithms successfully guaranteed certain bounds on the regret. However appealing from a theoret-
ical point of view, a practical concern was soon raised regarding the assumption that a tight Lipschitz
constant is known. Some researchers relaxed this somewhat strong assumption by proposing proce-
dures to estimate a Lipschitz constant during the optimization process [10, 11, 12].
Bayesian optimization is an efficient way to relax this assumption of complete knowledge of the Lip-
schitz constant, and has become a well-recognized method for solving global optimization problems
with non-convex black-box functions. In the machine learning community, Bayesian optimization—
especially by means of a Gaussian process (GP)—is an active research area [13, 14, 15]. With the
requirement of the access to the δ-cover sampling procedure (it samples the function uniformly such
that the density of samples doubles in the feasible regions at each iteration), de Freitas et al. [1] re-
cently proposed a theoretical procedure that maintains an exponential convergence rate (exponential
regret). However, as pointed out by Wang et al. [2], one remaining problem is to derive a GP-based
optimization method with an exponential convergence rate without the δ-cover sampling procedure,
which is computationally too demanding in many cases.
In this paper, we propose a novel GP-based global optimization algorithm, which maintains an
exponential convergence rate and converges rapidly without the δ-cover sampling procedure.

2 Gaussian Process Optimization
In Gaussian process optimization, we estimate the distribution over function f and use this informa-
tion to decide which point of f should be evaluated next. In a parametric approach, we consider a pa-
rameterized function f(x; θ), with θ being distributed according to some prior. In contrast, the non-
parametric GP approach directly puts the GP prior over f as f(∙) ∼ GP (m(∙), κ(∙, ∙)) where m(∙) is
the mean function and κ(∙, ∙) is the covariance function or the kernel. That is, m(x) = E[f(x)] and
κ(x, x′) = E[(f(x)−m(x))(f(x′)−m(x′))T ]. For a finite set of points, the GP model is simply a
joint Gaussian: f(x1:N ) ∼ N (m(x1:N ),K), where Ki,j = κ(xi, xj) and N is the number of data
points. To predict the value of f at a new data point, we first consider the joint distribution over f
of the old data points and the new data point:
(
f(x1:N )
f(xN+1)
)
∼ N
(
m(x1:N )
m(xN+1)
,
[
K k
kT κ(xN+1, xN+1)
])
where k = κ(x1:N ,xN+1) ∈ RN×1. Then, after factorizing the joint distribution using the Schur
complement for the joint Gaussian, we obtain the conditional distribution, conditioned on observed
entities DN := {x1:N , f(x1:N )} and xN+1, as:
f(xN+1)|DN , xN+1 ∼ N (μ(xN+1|DN ), σ
2(xN+1|DN ))
where μ(xN+1|DN ) = m(xN+1) + kT K−1(f(x1:N ) − m(x1:N )) and σ
2(xN+1|DN ) =
κ(xN+1,xN+1) − kT K−1k. One advantage of GP is that this closed-form solution simplifies both
its analysis and implementation.
To use a GP, we must specify the mean function and the covariance function. The mean function is
usually set to be zero. With this zero mean function, the conditional mean μ(xN+1|DN ) can still
be flexibly specified by the covariance function, as shown in the above equation for μ. For the co-
variance function, there are several common choices, including the Matern kernel and the Gaussian
kernel. For example, the Gaussian kernel is defined as κ(x, x′) = exp
(
− 12 (x − x
′)T Σ−1(x − x′)
)
where Σ−1 is the kernel parameter matrix. The kernel parameters or hyperparameters can be esti-
mated by empirical Bayesian methods [16]; see [17] for more information about GP.
The flexibility and simplicity of the GP prior make it a common choice for continuous objective
functions in the Bayesian optimization literature. Bayesian optimization with GP selects the next
query point that optimizes the acquisition function generated by GP. Commonly used acquisition
functions include the upper confidence bound (UCB) and expected improvement (EI). For brevity,
we consider Bayesian optimization with UCB, which works as follows. At each iteration, the UCB
function U is maintained as U(x|DN ) = μ(x|DN ) + ςσ(x|DN ) where ς ∈ R is a parameter of the
algorithm. To find the next query xn+1 for the objective function f , GP-UCB solves an additional
non-convex optimization problem with U as xN+1 = arg maxx U(x|DN ). This is often carried out
by other global optimization methods such as DIRECT and CMA-ES. The justification for intro-
ducing a new optimization problem lies in the assumption that the cost of evaluating the objective
function f dominates that of solving additional optimization problem.
For deterministic function, de Freitas et al. [1] recently presented a theoretical procedure that main-
tains exponential convergence rate. However, their own paper and the follow-up research [1, 2] point
out that this result relies on an impractical sampling procedure, the δ-cover sampling. To overcome
this issue, Wang et al. [2] combined GP-UCB with a hierarchical partitioning optimization method,
the SOO algorithm [18], providing a regret bound with polynomial dependence on the number of
function evaluations. They concluded that creating a GP-based algorithm with an exponential con-
vergence rate without the impractical sampling procedure remained an open problem.
3 Infinite-Metric GP Optimization
3.1 Overview
The GP-UCB algorithm can be seen as a member of the class of bound-based search methods,
which includes Lipschitz optimization, A* search, and PAC-MDP algorithms with optimism in the
face of uncertainty. Bound-based search methods have a common property: the tightness of the
bound determines its effectiveness. The tighter the bound is, the better the performance becomes.
2
However, it is often difficult to obtain a tight bound while maintaining correctness. For example,
in A* search, admissible heuristics maintain the correctness of the bound, but the estimated bound
with admissibility is often too loose in practice, resulting in a long period of global search.
The GP-UCB algorithm has the same problem. The bound in GP-UCB is represented by UCB,
which has the following property: f(x) ≤ U(x|D) with some probability. We formalize this prop-
erty in the analysis of our algorithm. The problem is essentially due to the difficulty of obtaining a
tight bound U(x|D) such that f(x) ≤ U(x|D) and f(x) ≈ U(x|D) (with some probability). Our
solution strategy is to first admit that the bound encoded in GP prior may not be tight enough to be
useful by itself. Instead of relying on a single bound given by the GP, we leverage the existence of
an unknown bound encoded in the continuity at a global optimizer.
Assumption 1. (Unknown Bound) There exists a global optimizer x∗ and an unknown semi-metric
` such that for all x ∈ Ω, f(x∗) ≤ f(x) + ` (x, x∗) and ` (x, x∗) < ∞.
In other words, we do not expect the known upper bound due to GP to be tight, but instead expect that
there exists some unknown bound that might be tighter. Notice that in the case where the bound by
GP is as tight as the unknown bound by semi-metric ` in Assumption 1, our method still maintains an
exponential convergence rate and an advantage over GP-UCB (no need for auxiliary optimization).
Our method is expected to become relatively much better when the known bound due to GP is less
tight compared to the unknown bound by `.
As the semi-metric ` is unknown, there are infinitely many possible candidates that we can think of
for `. Accordingly, we simultaneously conduct global and local searches based on all the candidates
of the bounds. The bound estimated by GP is used to reduce the number of candidates. Since
the bound estimated by GP is known, we can ignore the candidates of the bounds that are looser
than the bound estimated by GP. The source code of the proposed algorithm is publicly available at
http://lis.csail.mit.edu/code/imgpo.html.
3.2 Description of Algorithm
Figure 1 illustrates how the algorithm works with a simple 1-dimensional objective function. We
employ hierarchical partitioning to maintain hyperintervals, as illustrated by the line segments in the
figure. We consider a hyperrectangle as our hyperinterval, with its center being the evaluation point
of f (blue points in each line segment in Figure 1). For each iteration t, the algorithm performs the
following procedure for each interval size:
(i) Select the interval with the maximum center value among the intervals of the same size.
(ii) Keep the interval selected by (i) if it has a center value greater than that of any larger
interval.
(iii) Keep the interval accepted by (ii) if it contains a UCB greater than the center value of any
smaller interval.
(iv) If an interval is accepted by (iii), divide it along with the longest coordinate into three new
intervals.
(v) For each new interval, if the UCB of the evaluation point is less than the best function value
found so far, skip the evaluation and use the UCB value as the center value until the interval
is accepted in step (ii) on some future iteration; otherwise, evaluate the center value.
(vi) Repeat steps (i)–(v) until every size of intervals are considered
Then, at the end of each iteration, the algorithm updates the GP hyperparameters. Here, the purpose
of steps (i)–(iii) is to select an interval that might contain the global optimizer. Steps (i) and (ii)
select the possible intervals based on the unknown bound by `, while Step (iii) does so based on the
bound by GP.
We now explain the procedure using the example in Figure 1. Let n be the number of divisions of
intervals and let N be the number of function evaluations. t is the number of iterations. Initially,
there is only one interval (the center of the input region Ω ⊂ R) and thus this interval is divided,
resulting in the first diagram of Figure 1. At the beginning of iteration t = 2 , step (i) selects the third
interval from the left side in the first diagram (t = 1, n = 2), as its center value is the maximum.
Because there are no intervals of different size at this point, steps (ii) and (iii) are skipped. Step
(iv) divides the third interval, and then the GP hyperparameters are updated, resulting in the second

splits), N is the number of function evaluations.
diagram (t = 2, n = 3). At the beginning of iteration t = 3, it starts conducting steps (i)–(v) for the
largest intervals. Step (i) selects the second interval from the left side and step (ii) is skipped. Step
(iii) accepts the second interval, because the UCB within this interval is no less than the center value
of the smaller intervals, resulting in the third diagram (t = 3, n = 4). Iteration t = 3 continues
by conducting steps (i)–(v) for the smaller intervals. Step (i) selects the second interval from the
left side, step (ii) accepts it, and step (iii) is skipped, resulting in the forth diagram (t = 3, n = 4).
The effect of the step (v) can be seen in the diagrams for iteration t = 9. At n = 16, the far right
interval is divided, but no function evaluation occurs. Instead, UCB values given by GP are placed
in the new intervals indicated by the red asterisks. One of the temporary dummy values is resolved
at n = 17 when the interval is queried for division, as shown by the green asterisk. The effect of
step (iii) for the rejection case is illustrated in the last diagram for iteration t = 10. At n = 18, t is
increased to 10 from 9, meaning that the largest intervals are first considered for division. However,
the three largest intervals are all rejected in step (iii), resulting in the division of a very small interval
near the global optimum at n = 18.
3.3 Technical Detail of Algorithm
We define h to be the depth of the hierarchical partitioning tree, and ch,i to be the center point
of the ith hyperrectangle at depth h. Ngp is the number of the GP evaluations. Define depth(T )
to be the largest integer h such that the set Th is not empty. To compute UCB U , we use ςM =√
2 log(π2M2/12η) where M is the number of the calls made so far for U (i.e., each time we use U ,
we increment M by one). This particular form of ςM is to maintain the property of f(x) ≤ U(x|D)
during an execution of our algorithm with probability at least 1 − η. Here, η is the parameter of
IMGPO. Ξmax is another parameter, but it is only used to limit the possibly long computation of
step (iii) (in the worst case, step (iii) computes UCBs 3Ξmax times although it would rarely happen).
The pseudocode is shown in Algorithm 1. Lines 8 to 23 correspond to steps (i)-(iii). These lines
compute the index i∗h of the candidate of the rectangle that may contain a global optimizer for each
depth h. For each depth h, non-null index i∗h at Line 24 indicates the remaining candidate of a
rectangle that we want to divide. Lines 24 to 33 correspond to steps (iv)-(v) where the remaining
candidates of the rectangles for all h are divided. To provide a simple executable division scheme
(line 29), we assume Ω to be a hyperrectangle (see the last paragraph of section 4 for a general case).
Lines 8 to 17 correspond to steps (i)-(ii). Specifically, line 10 implements step (i) where a single
candidate is selected for each depth, and lines 11 to 12 conduct step (ii) where some candidates are
screened out. Lines 13 to 17 resolve the the temporary dummy values computed by GP. Lines 18
to 23 correspond to step (iii) where the candidates are further screened out. At line 21, T ′h+ξ(ch,i∗h)
indicates the set of all center points of a fully expanded tree until depth h + ξ within the region
covered by the hyperrectangle centered at ch,i∗h . In other words, T
′
h+ξ(ch,i∗h) contains the nodes of
the fully expanded tree rooted at ch,i∗h with depth ξ and can be computed by dividing the current
rectangle at ch,i∗h and recursively divide all the resulting new rectangles until depth ξ (i.e., depth ξ
from ch,i∗h , which is depth h + ξ in the whole tree).

3.4 Relationship to Previous Algorithms
The most closely related algorithm is the BaMSOO algorithm [2], which combines SOO with GP-
UCB. However, it only achieves a polynomial regret bound while IMGPO achieves a exponential
regret bound. IMGPO can achieve exponential regret because it utilizes the information encoded in
the GP prior/posterior to reduce the degree of the unknownness of the semi-metric `.
The idea of considering a set of infinitely many bounds was first proposed by Jones et al. [19]. Their
DIRECT algorithm has been successfully applied to real-world problems [4, 5], but it only maintains
the consistency property (i.e., convergence in the limit) from a theoretical viewpoint. DIRECT takes
an input parameter  to balance the global and local search efforts. This idea was generalized to the
case of an unknown semi-metric and strengthened with a theoretical support (finite regret bound) by
5
Munos [18] in the SOO algorithm. By limiting the depth of the search tree with a parameter hmax,
the SOO algorithm achieves a finite regret bound that depends on the near-optimality dimension.
4 Analysis
In this section, we prove an exponential convergence rate of IMGPO and theoretically discuss the
reason why the novel idea underling IMGPO is beneficial. The proofs are provided in the supple-
mentary material. To examine the effect of considering infinitely many possible candidates of the
bounds, we introduce the following term.
Definition 1. (Infinite-metric exploration loss). The infinite-metric exploration loss ρt is the number
of intervals to be divided during iteration t.
The infinite-metric exploration loss ρτ can be computed as ρt =
∑depth(T )
h=1 1(i
∗
h 6= ∅) at line
25. It is the cost (in terms of the number of function evaluations) incurred by not committing to
any particular upper bound. If we were to rely on a specific bound, ρτ would be minimized to 1.
For example, the DOO algorithm [18] has ρt = 1 ∀t ≥ 1. Even if we know a particular upper
bound, relying on this knowledge and thus minimizing ρτ is not a good option unless the known
bound is tight enough compared to the unknown bound leveraged in our algorithm. This will be
clarified in our analysis. Let ρ̄t be the maximum of the averages of ρ1:t′ for t′ = 1, 2, ..., t (i.e.,
ρ̄t ≡ max({ 1t′
∑t′
τ=1 ρτ ; t
′ = 1, 2, ..., t}).
Assumption 2. There exist L > 0, α > 0 and p ≥ 1 in R such that for all x, x′ ∈ Ω, `(x′, x) ≤
L||x′ − x||αp .
In Theorem 1, we show that the exponential convergence rate O
(
λN+Ngp
)
with λ < 1 is achieved.
We define Ξn ≤ Ξmax to be the largest ξ used so far with n total node expansions. For simplicity,
we assume that Ω is a square, which we satisfied in our experiments by scaling original Ω.
Theorem 1. Assume Assumptions 1 and 2. Let β = supx,x′∈Ω
1
2‖x−x
′‖∞. Let λ = 3
− α2CDρ̄t < 1.
Then, with probability at least 1 − η, the regret of IMGPO is bounded as
rN ≤ L(3βD
1/p)α exp
(
−α
[
N + Ngp
2CDρ̄t
− Ξn − 2
]
ln 3
)
= O
(
λN+Ngp
)
.
Importantly, our bound holds for the best values of the unknown L,α and p even though these
values are not given. The closest result in previous work is that of BaMSOO [2], which obtained
Õ(n−
2α
D(4−α) ) with probability 1 − η for α = {1, 2}. As can be seen, we have improved the regret
bound. Additionally, in our analysis, we can see how L, p, and α affect the bound, allowing us
to view the inherent difficulty of an objective function in a theoretical perspective. Here, C is a
constant in N and is used in previous work [18, 2]. For example, if we conduct 2D or 3D − 1
function evaluations per node-expansion and if p = ∞, we have that C = 1.
We note that λ can get close to one as input dimension D increases, which suggests that there
is a remaining challenge in scalability for higher dimensionality. One strategy for addressing this
problem would be to leverage additional assumptions such as those in [14, 20].
Remark 1. (The effect of the tightness of UCB by GP) If UCB computed by GP is “useful” such
that N/ρ̄t = Ω(N), then our regret bound becomes O
(
exp
(
−N+Ngp2CD α ln 3
))
. If the bound due to
UCB by GP is too loose (and thus useless), ρ̄t can increase up to O(N/t) (due to ρ̄t ≤
∑t
i=1 i/t ≤
O(N/t)), resulting in the regret bound of O
(
exp
(
− t(1+Ngp/N)2CD α ln 3
))
, which can be bounded
by O
(
exp
(
−N+Ngp2CD max(
1√
N
, tN )α ln 3
))
1. This is still better than the known results.
Remark 2. (The effect of GP) Without the use of GP, our regret bound would be as follows: rN ≤
L(3βD1/p)α exp(−α[ N2CD
1
ρ̃t
−2] ln 3), where ρ̄t ≤ ρ̃t is the infinite-metric exploration loss without
1This can be done by limiting the depth of search tree as depth(T ) = O(
√
N). Our proof works with this
additional mechanism, but results in the regret bound with N being replaced by
√
N . Thus, if we assume to
have at least “not useless” UCBs such that N/ρ̄t = Ω(
√
N), this additional mechanism can be disadvanta-
geous. Accordingly, we do not adopt it in our experiments.
6
GP. Therefore, the use of GP reduces the regret bound by increasing Ngp and decreasing ρ̄t, but may
potentially increase the bound by increasing Ξn ≤ Ξ.
Remark 3. (The effect of infinite-metric optimization) To understand the effect of considering all
the possible upper bounds, we consider the case without GP. If we consider all the possible bounds,
we have the regret bound L(3βD1/p)α exp(−α[ N
2CD
1
ρ̃t
− 2] ln 3) for the best unknown L, α and p.
For standard optimization with a estimated bound, we have L′(3βD1/p
′
)α
′
exp(−α′[ N
2C′D
− 2] ln 3)
for an estimated L′, α′, and p′. By algebraic manipulation, considering all the possible bounds has
a better regret when ρ̃−1t ≥
2CD
N ln 3α ((
N
2C′D − 2) ln 3
α′ +2 ln 3α − ln L
′(3βD1/p
′
)α
′
L(3βD1/p)α
). For an intuitive
insight, we can simplify the above by assuming α′ = α and C ′ = C as ρ̃−1t ≥ 1−
Cc2D
N ln
L′Dα/p
′
LDα/p
.
Because L and p are the ones that achieve the lowest bound, the logarithm on the right-hand side is
always non-negative. Hence, ρ̃t = 1 always satisfies the condition. When L′ and p′ are not tight
enough, the logarithmic term increases in magnitude, allowing ρ̃t to increase. For example, if the
second term on the right-hand side has a magnitude of greater than 0.5, then ρ̃t = 2 satisfies the
inequality. Therefore, even if we know the upper bound of the function, we can see that it may be
better not to rely on this, but rather take the infinite many possibilities into account.
One may improve the algorithm with different division procedures than one presented in Algorithm
1. Accordingly, in the supplementary material, we derive an abstract version of the regret bound for
IMGPO with a family of division procedures that satisfy some assumptions. This information could
be used to design a new division procedure.
5 Experiments
In this section, we compare the IMGPO algorithm with the SOO, BaMSOO, GP-PI and GP-EI algo-
rithms [18, 2, 3]. In previous work, BaMSOO and GP-UCB were tested with a pair of a handpicked
good kernel and hyperparameters for each function [2]. In our experiments, we assume that the
knowledge of good kernel and hyperparameters is unavailable, which is usually the case in practice.
Thus, for IMGPO, BaMSOO, GP-PI and GP-EI, we simply used one of the most popular kernels,
the isotropic Matern kernel with ν = 5/2. This is given by κ(x, x′) = g(
√
5||x − x′||2/l), where
g(z) = σ2(1 + z + z2/3) exp(−z). Then, we blindly initialized the hyperparameters to σ = 1

and l = 0.25 for all the experiments; these values were updated with an empirical Bayesian method
after each iteration. To compute the UCB by GP, we used η = 0.05 for IMGPO and BaMSOO.
For IMGPO, Ξmax was fixed to be 22 (the effect of selecting different values is discussed later).
For BaMSOO and SOO, the parameter hmax was set to
√
n, according to Corollary 4.3 in [18].
For GP-PI and GP-EI, we used the SOO algorithm and a local optimization method using gradients
to solve the auxiliary optimization. For SOO, BaMSOO and IMGPO, we used the corresponding
deterministic division procedure (given Ω, the initial point is fixed and no randomness exists). For
GP-PI and GP-EI, we randomly initialized the first evaluation point and report the mean and one
standard deviation for 50 runs.
The experimental results for eight different objective functions are shown in Figure 2. The vertical
axis is log10(f(x∗) − f(x+)), where f(x∗) is the global optima and f(x+) is the best value found
by the algorithm. Hence, the lower the plotted value on the vertical axis, the better the algorithm’s
performance. The last five functions are standard benchmarks for global optimization [21]. The first
two were used in [18] to test SOO, and can be written as fsin1(x) = (sin(13x) sin+1)/2 for Sin1
and fsin2(x) = fsin1(x1)fsin1(x2) for Sin2. The form of the third function is given in Equation
(16) and Figure 2 in [22]. The last function is Sin2 embedded in 1000 dimension in the same manner
described in Section 4.1 in [14], which is used here to illustrate a possibility of using IMGPO as a
main subroutine to scale up to higher dimensions with additional assumptions. For this function,
we used REMBO [14] with IMGPO and BaMSOO as its Bayesian optimization subroutine. All of
these functions are multimodal, except for Rosenbrock2, with dimensionality from 1 to 1000.
As we can see from Figure 2, IMGPO outperformed the other algorithms in general. SOO produced
the competitive results for Rosenbrock2 because our GP prior was misleading (i.e., it did not model
the objective function well and thus the property f(x) ≤ U(x|D) did not hold many times). As can
be seen in Table 1, IMGPO is much faster than traditional GP optimization methods although it is
slower than SOO. For Sin 1, Sin2, Branin and Hartmann3, increasing Ξmax does not affect IMGPO
because Ξn did not reach Ξmax = 22 (Figure 2). For the rest of the test functions, we would be able
to improve the performance of IMGPO by increasing Ξmax at the cost of extra CPU time.
6 Conclusion
We have presented the first GP-based optimization method with an exponential convergence rate
O
(
λN+Ngp
)
(λ < 1) without the need of auxiliary optimization and the δ-cover sampling. Perhaps
more importantly in the viewpoint of a broader global optimization community, we have provided
a practically oriented analysis framework, enabling us to see why not relying on a particular bound
is advantageous, and how a non-tight bound can still be useful (in Remarks 1, 2 and 3). Following
the advent of the DIRECT algorithm, the literature diverged along two paths, one with a particular
bound and one without. GP-UCB can be categorized into the former. Our approach illustrates the
benefits of combining these two paths.
As stated in Section 3.1, our solution idea was to use a bound-based method but rely less on the
estimated bound by considering all the possible bounds. It would be interesting to see if a similar
principle can be applicable to other types of bound-based methods such as planning algorithms (e.g.,
A* search and the UCT or FSSS algorithm [23]) and learning algorithms (e.g., PAC-MDP algorithms
[24]).
