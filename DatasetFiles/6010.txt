Abstract
We study the problem of Robust Least Squares Regression (RLSR) where several
response variables can be adversarially corrupted. More specifically, for a data
matrix X ∈ Rp×n and an underlying model w∗, the response vector is generated
as y = XTw∗ +b where b ∈ Rn is the corruption vector supported over at most
C · n coordinates. Existing exact recovery results for RLSR focus solely on L1-
penalty based convex formulations and impose relatively strict model assumptions
such as requiring the corruptions b to be selected independently of X .
In this work, we study a simple hard-thresholding algorithm called TORRENT
which, under mild conditions on X , can recover w∗ exactly even if b corrupts the
response variables in an adversarial manner, i.e. both the support and entries of b
are selected adversarially after observingX and w∗. Our results hold under deter-
ministic assumptions which are satisfied if X is sampled from any sub-Gaussian
distribution. Finally unlike existing results that apply only to a fixed w∗, generated
independently of X , our results are universal and hold for any w∗ ∈ Rp.
Next, we propose gradient descent-based extensions of TORRENT that can scale
efficiently to large scale problems, such as high dimensional sparse recovery. and
prove similar recovery guarantees for these extensions. Empirically we find TOR-
RENT, and more so its extensions, offering significantly faster recovery than the
state-of-the-art L1 solvers. For instance, even on moderate-sized datasets (with
p = 50K) with around 40% corrupted responses, a variant of our proposed
method called TORRENT-HYB is more than 20× faster than the best L1 solver.
“If among these errors are some which appear too large to be admissible,
then those equations which produced these errors will be rejected, as com-
ing from too faulty experiments, and the unknowns will be determined by
means of the other equations, which will then give much smaller errors.”

1 Introduction
Robust Least Squares Regression (RLSR) addresses the problem of learning a reliable set of regres-
sion coefficients in the presence of several arbitrary corruptions in the response vector. Owing to the
wide-applicability of regression, RLSR features as a critical component of several important real-
world applications in a variety of domains such as signal processing [1], economics [2], computer
vision [3, 4], and astronomy [2].
Given a data matrix X = [x1, . . . ,xn] with n data points in Rp and the corresponding response
vector y ∈ Rn, the goal of RLSR is to learn a ŵ such that,
(ŵ, Ŝ) = arg min
w∈Rp
S⊂[n]:|S|≥(1−β)·n

That is, we wish to simultaneously determine the set of corruption free points Ŝ and also estimate
the best model parameters over the set of clean points. However, the optimization problem given
above is non-convex (jointly in w and S) in general and might not directly admit efficient solutions.
Indeed there exist reformulations of this problem that are known to be NP-hard to optimize [1].
To address this problem, most existing methods with provable guarantees assume that the obser-
vations are obtained from some generative model. A commonly adopted model is the following
y = XTw∗ + b, (2)
where w∗ ∈ Rp is the true model vector that we wish to estimate and b ∈ Rn is the corruption
vector that can have arbitrary values. A common assumption is that the corruption vector is sparsely
supported i.e. ‖b‖0 ≤ α · n for some α > 0.
Recently, [4] and [5] obtained a surprising result which shows that one can recover w∗ exactly even
when α . 1, i.e., when almost all the points are corrupted, by solving an L1-penalty based convex
optimization problem: minw,b ‖w‖1 + λ ‖b‖1, s.t., X>w + b = y. However, these results require
the corruption vector b to be selected oblivious of X and w∗. Moreover, the results impose severe
restrictions on the data distribution, requiring that the data be either sampled from an isotropic
Gaussian ensemble [4], or row-sampled from an incoherent orthogonal matrix [5]. Finally, these
results hold only for a fixed w∗ and are not universal in general.
In contrast, [6] studied RLSR with less stringent assumptions, allowing arbitrary corruptions in
response variables as well as in the data matrix X , and proposed a trimmed inner product based
algorithm for the problem. However, their recovery guarantees are significantly weaker. Firstly,
they are able to recover w∗ only upto an additive error α
√
p (or α
√
s if w∗ is s-sparse). Hence, they
require α ≤ 1/√p just to claim a non-trivial bound. Note that this amounts to being able to tolerate
only a vanishing fraction of corruptions. More importantly, even with n→∞ and extremely small
α they are unable to guarantee exact recovery of w∗. A similar result was obtained by [7], albeit
using a sub-sampling based algorithm with stronger assumptions on b.
In this paper, we focus on a simple and natural thresholding based algorithm for RLSR. At a high
level, at each step t, our algorithm alternately estimates an active set St of “clean” points and then
updates the model to obtain wt+1 by minimizing the least squares error on the active set. This
intuitive algorithm seems to embody a long standing heuristic first proposed by Legendre [8] over
two centuries ago (see introductory quotation in this paper) that has been adopted in later literature
[9, 10] as well. However, to the best of our knowledge, this technique has never been rigorously
analyzed before in non-asymptotic settings, despite its appealing simplicity.
Our Contributions: The main contribution of this paper is an exact recovery guarantee for the
thresholding algorithm mentioned above that we refer to as TORRENT-FC (see Algorithm 1). We
provide our guarantees in the model given in 2 where the corruptions b are selected adversarially but
restricted to have at most α · n non-zero entries where α is a global constant dependent only on X1.
Under deterministic conditions on X , namely the subset strong convexity (SSC) and smoothness
(SSS) properties (see Definition 1), we guarantee that TORRENT-FC converges at a geometric rate
and recovers w∗ exactly. We further show that these properties (SSC and SSS) are satisfied w.h.p.
if a) the data X is sampled from a sub-Gaussian distribution and, b) n ≥ p log p.
We would like to stress three key advantages of our result over the results of [4, 5]: a) we allow b
to be adversarial, i.e., both support and values of b to be selected adversarially based on X and w∗,
b) we make assumptions on data that are natural, as well as significantly less restrictive than what
existing methods make, and c) our analysis admits universal guarantees, i.e., holds for any w∗.
We would also like to stress that while hard-thresholding based methods have been studied rigor-
ously for the sparse-recovery problem [11, 12], hard-thresholding has not been studied formally
for the robust regression problem. [13] study soft-thresholding approaches to the robust regression
problem but without any formal guarantees. Moreover, the two problems are completely different
and hence techniques from sparse-recovery analysis do not extend to robust regression.
1Note that for an adaptive adversary, as is the case in our work, recovery cannot be guaranteed for α ≥ 1/2
since the adversary can introduce corruptions as bi = x>i (w̃−w∗) for an adversarially chosen model w̃. This
would make it impossible for any algorithm to distinguish between w∗ and w̃ thus making recovery impossible.
2
Despite its simplicity, TORRENT-FC does not scale very well to datasets with large p as it solves
least squares problems at each iteration. We address this issue by designing a gradient descent
based algorithm (TORRENT-GD), and a hybrid algorithm (TORRENT-Hyb), both of which enjoy a
geometric rate of convergence and can recover w∗ under the model assumptions mentioned above.
We also propose extensions of TORRENT for the RLSR problem in the sparse regression setting
where p  n but ‖w∗‖0 = s∗  p. Our algorithm TORRENT-HD is based on TORRENT-FC but
uses the Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm, a popular algorithm for sparse regression. As
before, we show that TORRENT-HD also converges geometrically to w∗ if a) the corruption index α
is less than some constant C, b)X is sampled from a sub-Gaussian distribution and, c) n ≥ s∗ log p.
Finally, we experimentally evaluate existing L1-based algorithms and our hard thresholding-based
algorithms. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms (TORRENT-(FC/GD/HYB)) can
be significantly faster than the best L1 solvers, exhibit better recovery properties, as well as be more
robust to dense white noise. For instance, on a problem with 50K dimensions and 40% corruption,
TORRENT-HYB was found to be 20× faster than L1 solvers, as well as achieve lower error rates.
2 Problem Formulation
Given a set of data points X = [x1,x2, . . . ,xn], where xi ∈ Rp and the corresponding response
vector y ∈ Rn, the goal is to recover a parameter vector w∗ which solves the RLSR problem (1).
We assume that the response vector y is generated using the following model:
y = y∗ + b + ε, where y∗ = X>w∗.
Hence, in the above model, (1) reduces to estimating w∗. We allow the model w∗ representing the
regressor, to be chosen in an adaptive manner after the data features have been generated.
The above model allows two kinds of perturbations to yi – dense but bounded noise εi (e.g. white
noise εi ∼ N (0, σ2), σ ≥ 0), as well as potentially unbounded corruptions bi – to be introduced
by an adversary. The only requirement we enforce is that the gross corruptions be sparse. ε shall
represent the dense noise vector, for example ε ∼ N (0, σ2 ·In×n), and b, the corruption vector such
that ‖b‖0 ≤ α·n for some corruption index α > 0. We shall use the notation S∗ = supp(b) ⊆ [n] to
denote the set of “clean” points, i.e. points that have not faced unbounded corruptions. We consider
adaptive adversaries that are able to view the generated data points xi, as well as the clean responses
y∗i and dense noise values εi before deciding which locations to corrupt and by what amount.
We denote the unit sphere in p dimensions using Sp−1. For any γ ∈ (0, 1], we let Sγ =
{S ⊂ [n] : |S| = γ · n} denote the set of all subsets of size γ · n. For any set S, we let XS :=
[xi]i∈S ∈ Rp×|S| denote the matrix whose columns are composed of points in that set. Also, for
any vector v ∈ Rn we use the notation vS to denote the |S|-dimensional vector consisting of those
components that are in S. We use λmin(X) and λmax(X) to denote, respectively, the smallest and
largest eigenvalues of a square symmetric matrix X . We now introduce two properties, namely,
Subset Strong Convexity and Subset Strong Smoothness, which are key to our analyses.
Definition 1 (SSC and SSS Properties). A matrix X ∈ Rp×n satisfies the Subset Strong Convexity
Property (resp. Subset Strong Smoothness Property) at level γ with strong convexity constant λγ
(resp. strong smoothness constant Λγ) if the following holds:
λγ ≤ min
S∈Sγ
λmin(XSX
>
S ) ≤ max
S∈Sγ
λmax(XSX
>
S ) ≤ Λγ .
Remark 1. We note that the uniformity enforced in the definitions of the SSC and SSS properties is
not for the sake of convenience but rather a necessity. Indeed, a uniform bound is required in face of
an adversary which can perform corruptions after data and response variables have been generated,
and choose to corrupt precisely that set of points where the SSC and SSS parameters are the worst.
3 TORRENT: Thresholding Operator-based Robust Regression Method
We now present TORRENT, a Thresholding Operator-based Robust RegrEssioN meThod for per-
forming robust regression at scale. Key to our algorithms is the Hard Thresholding Operator which
we define below.

Definition 2 (Hard Thresholding Operator). For any vector v ∈ Rn, let σv ∈ Sn be the permutation
that orders elements of v in ascending order of their magnitudes i.e.
∣∣vσv(1)∣∣ ≤ ∣∣vσv(2)∣∣ ≤ . . . ≤∣∣vσv(n)∣∣. Then for any k ≤ n, we define the hard thresholding operator as
HT(v; k) =
{
i ∈ [n] : σ−1v (i) ≤ k
}
Using this operator, we present our algorithm TORRENT (Algorithm 1) for robust regression. TOR-
RENT follows a most natural iterative strategy of, alternately, estimating an active set of points which
have the least residual error on the current regressor, and then updating the regressor to provide a
better fit on this active set. We offer three variants of our algorithm, based on how aggressively the
algorithm tries to fit the regressor to the current active set.
We first propose a fully corrective algorithm TORRENT-FC (Algorithm 2) that performs a fully
corrective least squares regression step in an effort to minimize the regression error on the active set.
This algorithm makes significant progress in each step, but at a cost of more expensive updates. To
address this, we then propose a milder, gradient descent-based variant TORRENT-GD (Algorithm 3)
that performs a much cheaper update of taking a single step in the direction of the gradient of the
objective function on the active set. This reduces the regression error on the active set but does not
minimize it. This turns out to be beneficial in situations where dense noise is present along with
sparse corruptions since it prevents the algorithm from overfitting to the current active set.
Both the algorithms proposed above have their pros and cons – the FC algorithm provides significant
improvements with each step, but is expensive to execute whereas the GD variant, although efficient
in executing each step, offers slower progress. To get the best of both these algorithms, we propose
a third, hybrid variant TORRENT-HYB (Algorithm 4) that adaptively selects either the FC or the GD
update depending on whether the active set is stable across iterations or not.
In the next section we show that this hard thresholding-based strategy offers a linear convergence
rate for the algorithm in all its three variations. We shall also demonstrate the applicability of this
technique to high dimensional sparse recovery settings in a subsequent section.
4 Convergence Guarantees
For the sake of ease of exposition, we will first present our convergence analyses for cases where
dense noise is not present i.e. y = X>w∗ + b and will handle cases with dense noise and sparse
corruptions later. We first analyze the fully corrective TORRENT-FC algorithm. The convergence
proof in this case relies on the optimality of the two steps carried out by the algorithm, the fully
corrective step that selects the best regressor on the active set, and the hard thresholding step that
discovers a new active set by selecting points with the least residual error on the current regressor.

Theorem 3. Let X = [x1, . . . ,xn] ∈ Rp×n be the given data matrix and y = XTw∗ + b be the
corrupted output with ‖b‖0 ≤ α · n. Let Algorithm 2 be executed on this data with the thresholding
parameter set to β ≥ α. Let Σ0 be an invertible matrix such that X̃ = Σ−1/20 X satisfies the
SSC and SSS properties at level γ with constants λγ and Λγ respectively (see Definition 1). If the
data satisfies (1+

iterations, Algorithm 2 obtains an
-accurate solution wt i.e. ‖wt −w∗‖2 ≤ .
Proof (Sketch). Let rt = y −X>wt be the vector of residuals at time t and Ct = XStX>St . Also
let S∗ = supp(b) be the set of uncorrupted points. The fully corrective step ensures that

Theorem 4. Let X = [x1, . . . ,xn] ∈ Rp×n be the given data matrix with each xi ∼ N (0,Σ). Let
y = X>w∗+b and ‖b‖0 ≤ α ·n. Also, let α ≤ β < 165 and n ≥ Ω

iterations of Algorithm 1 with the thresholding parameter set to β, we have
∥∥wT −w∗∥∥ ≤ .
Remark 2. Note that Theorem 4 provides rates that are independent of the condition number λmax(Σ)λmin(Σ)
of the distribution. We also note that results similar to Theorem 4 can be proven for the larger class
of sub-Gaussian distributions. We refer the reader to Section G for the same.
Remark 3. We remind the reader that our analyses can readily accommodate dense noise in addition
to sparse unbounded corruptions. We direct the reader to Appendix A which presents convergence
proofs for our algorithms in these settings.
Remark 4. We would like to point out that the design requirements made by our analyses are very
mild when compared to existing literature. Indeed, the work of [4] assumes the Bouquet Model
where distributions are restricted to be isotropic Gaussians whereas the work of [5] assumes a more
stringent model of sub-orthonormal matrices, something that even Gaussian designs do not satisfy.
Our analyses, on the other hand, hold for the general class of sub-Gaussian distributions.
We now analyze the TORRENT-GD algorithm which performs cheaper, gradient-style updates on
the active set. We will show that this method nevertheless enjoys a linear rate of convergence.
Theorem 5. Let the data settings be as stated in Theorem 3 and let Algorithm 3 be executed on this
data with the thresholding parameter set to β ≥ α and the step length set to η = 1Λ1−β . If the data

iterations, Algorithm 1
obtains an -accurate solution wt i.e. ‖wt −w∗‖2 ≤ .
Similar to TORRENT-FC, the assumptions made by the TORRENT-GD algorithm are also satisfied
by the class of sub-Gaussian distributions. The proof of Theorem 5, given in Appendix D, details
these arguments. Given the convergence analyses for TORRENT-FC and GD, we now move on to
provide a convergence analysis for the hybrid TORRENT-HYB algorithm which interleaves FC and
GD steps. Since the exact interleaving adopted by the algorithm depends on the data, and not known
in advance, this poses a problem. We address this problem by giving below a uniform convergence
guarantee, one that applies to every interleaving of the FC and GD update steps.
Theorem 6. Suppose Algorithm 4 is executed on data that allows Algorithms 2 and 3 a convergence
rate of ηFC and ηGD respectively. Suppose we have 2 ·ηFC ·ηGD < 1. Then for any interleavings of the
FC and GD steps that the policy may enforce, after t = O

iterations, Algorithm 4
ensures an -optimal solution i.e. ‖wt −w∗‖ ≤ .
We point out to the reader that the assumption made by Theorem 6 i.e. 2 · ηFC · ηGD < 1 is readily
satisfied by random sub-Gaussian designs, albeit at the cost of reducing the noise tolerance limit. As
we shall see, TORRENT-HYB offers attractive convergence properties, merging the fast convergence
rates of the FC step, as well as the speed and protection against overfitting provided by the GD step.
5 High-dimensional Robust Regression
In this section, we extend our approach to the robust high-dimensional sparse recovery setting. As
before, we assume that the response vector y is obtained as: y = X>w∗ + b, where ‖b‖0 ≤ α · n.
However, this time, we also assume that w∗ is s∗-sparse i.e. ‖w∗‖0 ≤ s∗. As before, we shall
neglect white/dense noise for the sake of simplicity. We reiterate that it is not possible to use existing
results from sparse recovery (such as [11, 12]) directly to solve this problem.
Our objective would be to recover a sparse model ŵ so that ‖ŵ −w∗‖2 ≤ . The challenge here
is to forgo a sample complexity of n & p and instead, perform recovery with n ∼ s∗ log p samples
alone. For this setting, we modify the FC update step of TORRENT-FC method to the following:
wt+1 ← inf
‖w‖0≤s
∑
i∈St
(yi − 〈w,xi〉)2 , (3)
for some target sparsity level s p. We refer to this modified algorithm as TORRENT-HD. Assum-
ing X satisfies the RSC/RSS properties (defined below), (3) can be solved efficiently using results
from sparse recovery (for example the IHT algorithm [11, 14] analyzed in [12]).
Definition 7 (RSC and RSS Properties). A matrix X ∈ Rp×n will be said to satisfy the Restricted
Strong Convexity Property (resp. Restricted Strong Smoothness Property) at level s = s1 + s2 with
strong convexity constant αs1+s2 (resp. strong smoothness constant Ls1+s2 ) if the following holds
for all ‖w1‖0 ≤ s1 and ‖w2‖0 ≤ s2:
αs ‖w1 −w2‖22 ≤
∥∥X>(w1 −w2)∥∥22 ≤ Ls ‖w1 −w2‖22
For our results, we shall require the subset versions of both these properties.
Definition 8 (SRSC and SRSS Properties). A matrix X ∈ Rp×n will be said to satisfy the Subset
Restricted Strong Convexity (resp. Subset Restricted Strong Smoothness) Property at level (γ, s)
with strong convexity constant α(γ,s) (resp. strong smoothness constant L(γ,s)) if for all subsets
S ∈ Sγ , the matrix XS satisfies the RSC (resp. RSS) property at level s with constant αs (resp. Ls).
We now state the convergence result for the TORRENT-HD algorithm.
Theorem 9. Let X ∈ Rp×n be the given data matrix and y = XTw∗ + b be the corrupted
output with ‖w∗‖0 ≤ s∗ and ‖b‖0 ≤ α · n. Let Σ0 be an invertible matrix such that Σ
−1/2
0 X
satisfies the SRSC and SRSS properties at level (γ, 2s+s∗) with constants α(γ,2s+s∗) and L(γ,2s+s∗)
respectively (see Definition 8). Let Algorithm 2 be executed on this data with the TORRENT-HD
update, thresholding parameter set to β ≥ α, and s ≥ 32

variants of TORRENT can be seen to recover w∗ in presence of larger number of corruptions than the L1 solver.

Remark 5. The sample complexity required by Theorem 9 is identical to the one required by analyses
for high dimensional sparse recovery [12], save constants. Also note that TORRENT-HD can tolerate
the same corruption index as TORRENT-FC.
6 Experiments
Several numerical simulations were carried out on linear regression problems in low-dimensional,
as well as sparse high-dimensional settings. The experiments show that TORRENT not only offers
statistically better recovery properties as compared to L1-style approaches, but that it can be more
than an order of magnitude faster as well.
Data: For the low dimensional setting, the regressor w∗ ∈ Rp was chosen to be a random unit norm
vector. Data was sampled as xi ∼ N (0, Ip) and response variables were generated as y∗i = 〈w∗,xi〉.
The set of corrupted points S∗ was selected as a uniformly random (αn)-sized subset of [n] and the
corruptions were set to bi ∼ U (−5 ‖y∗‖∞ , 5 ‖y∗‖∞) for i ∈ S∗. The corrupted responses were
then generated as yi = y∗i + bi + εi where εi ∼ N (0, σ2). For the sparse high-dimensional setting,
supp(w∗) was selected to be a random s∗-sized subset of [p]. Phase-transition diagrams (Figure 1)
were generated by repeating each experiment 100 times. For all other plots, each experiment was
run over 20 random instances of the data and the plots were drawn to depict the mean results.
Algorithms: We compared various variants of our algorithm TORRENT to the regularized L1 algo-
rithm for robust regression [4, 5]. Note that the L1 problem can be written as minz ‖z‖1 s.t.Az = y,
where A =
[
X> 1λIm×m
]
and z∗ = [w∗> λb>]>. We used the Dual Augmented Lagrange Mul-
tiplier (DALM) L1 solver implemented by [15] to solve the L1 problem. We ran a fine tuned grid
search over the λ parameter for the L1 solver and quoted the best results obtained from the search. In
the low-dimensional setting, we compared the recovery properties of TORRENT-FC (Algorithm 2)
and TORRENT-HYB (Algorithm 4) with the DALM-L1 solver, while for the high-dimensional case,
we compared TORRENT-HD against the DALM-L1 solver. Both the L1 solver, as well as our meth-
ods, were implemented in Matlab and were run on a single core 2.4GHz machine with 8 GB RAM.
Choice of L1-solver: An extensive comparative study of various L1 minimization algorithms was
performed by [15] who showed that the DALM and Homotopy solvers outperform other counterparts
both in terms of recovery properties, and timings. We extended their study to our observation model
and found the DALM solver to be significantly better than the other L1 solvers; see Figure 3 in the
appendix. We also observed, similar to [15], that the Approximate Message Passing (AMP) solver
diverges on our problem as the input matrix to the L1 solver is a non-Gaussian matrixA = [XT 1λI].

Figure 2: In low-dimensional (a,b), as well as sparse high dimensional (c,d) settings, TORRENT offers better
recovery as the fraction of corrupted points α is varied. In terms of runtime, TORRENT is an order of magnitude
faster than L1 solvers in both settings. In the low-dim. setting, TORRENT-HYB is the fastest of all the variants.
Evaluation Metric: We measure the performance of various algorithms using the standard L2 error:
rŵ = ‖ŵ −w∗‖2. For the phase-transition plots (Figure 1), we deemed an algorithm successful on
an instance if it obtained a model ŵ with error rŵ < 10−4 · ‖w∗‖2. We also measured the CPU
time required by each of the methods, so as to compare their scalability.
6.1 Low Dimensional Results
Recovery Property: The phase-transition plots presented in Figure 1 represent our recovery exper-
iments in graphical form. Both the fully-corrective and hybrid variants of TORRENT show better
recovery properties than the L1-minimization approach, indicated by the number of runs in which
the algorithm was able to correctly recover w∗ out of a 100 runs. Figure 2 shows the variation in
recovery error as a function of α in the presence of white noise and exhibits the superiority of TOR-
RENT-FC and TORRENT-HYB over L1-DALM. Here again, TORRENT-FC and TORRENT-HYB
achieve significantly lesser recovery error than L1-DALM for all α <= 0.5. Figure 3 in the ap-
pendix show that the variations of ‖ŵ −w∗‖2 with varying p, σ and n follow a similar trend with
TORRENT having significantly lower recovery error in comparison to the L1 approach.
Figure 1(d) brings out an interesting trend in the recovery property of TORRENT. As we increase
the magnitude of corruption from U (−‖y∗‖∞ , ‖y∗‖∞) to U (−20 ‖y∗‖∞ , 20 ‖y∗‖∞), the recov-
ery error for TORRENT-HYB and TORRENT-FC decreases as expected since it becomes easier to
identify the grossly corrupted points. However the L1-solver was unable to exploit this observation
and in fact exhibited an increase in recovery error.
Run Time: In order to ascertain the recovery guarantees for TORRENT on ill-conditioned problems,
we performed an experiment where data was sampled as xi ∼ N (0,Σ) where diag(Σ) ∼ U(0, 5).
Figure 2 plots the recovery error as a function of time. TORRENT-HYB was able to correctly recover
w∗ about 50× faster than L1-DALM which spent a considerable amount of time pre-processing the
data matrix X . Even after allowing the L1 algorithm to run for 500 iterations, it was unable to reach
the desired residual error of 10−4. Figure 2 also shows that our TORRENT-HYB algorithm is able to
converge to the optimal solution much faster than TORRENT-FC or TORRENT-GD. This is because
TORRENT-FC solves a least square problem at each step and thus, even though it requires signifi-
cantly fewer iterations to converge, each iteration in itself is very expensive. While each iteration of
TORRENT-GD is cheap, it is still limited by the slow O
(
(1− 1κ )
t
)
convergence rate of the gradient
descent algorithm, where κ is the condition number of the covariance matrix. TORRENT-HYB, on
the other hand, is able to combine the strengths of both the methods to achieve faster convergence.
6.2 High Dimensional Results
Recovery Property: Figure 2 shows the variation in recovery error in the high-dimensional setting
as the number of corrupted points was varied. For these experiments, n was set to 5s∗ log(p) and
the fraction of corrupted points α was varied from 0.1 to 0.7. While L1-DALM fails to recover w∗
for α > 0.5, TORRENT-HD offers perfect recovery even for α values upto 0.7.
Run Time: Figure 2 shows the variation in recovery error as a function of run time in this setting.
L1-DALM was found to be an order of magnitude slower than TORRENT-HD, making it infeasible
for sparse high-dimensional settings. One key reason for this is that the L1-DALM solver is signifi-
cantly slower in identifying the set of clean points. For instance, whereas TORRENT-HD was able to
identify the clean set of points in only 5 iterations, it took L1 around 250 iterations to do the same.
