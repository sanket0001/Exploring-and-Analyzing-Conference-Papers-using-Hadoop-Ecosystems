Abstract
Recently there has been substantial interest in spectral methods for learning dy-
namical systems. These methods are popular since they often offer a good tradeoff
between computational and statistical efficiency. Unfortunately, they can be dif-
ficult to use and extend in practice: e.g., they can make it difficult to incorporate
prior information such as sparsity or structure. To address this problem, we present
a new view of dynamical system learning: we show how to learn dynamical sys-
tems by solving a sequence of ordinary supervised learning problems, thereby
allowing users to incorporate prior knowledge via standard techniques such as
L1 regularization. Many existing spectral methods are special cases of this new
framework, using linear regression as the supervised learner. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework by showing examples where nonlinear regression
or lasso let us learn better state representations than plain linear regression does;
the correctness of these instances follows directly from our general analysis.
1 Introduction
Likelihood-based approaches to learning dynamical systems, such as EM [1] and MCMC [2], can
be slow and suffer from local optima. This difficulty has resulted in the development of so-called
“spectral algorithms” [3], which rely on factorization of a matrix of observable moments; these
algorithms are often fast, simple, and globally optimal.
Despite these advantages, spectral algorithms fall short in one important aspect compared to EM and
MCMC: the latter two methods are meta-algorithms or frameworks that offer a clear template for
developing new instances incorporating various forms of prior knowledge. For spectral algorithms,
by contrast, there is no clear template to go from a set of probabilistic assumptions to an algorithm.
In fact, researchers often relax model assumptions to make the algorithm design process easier,
potentially discarding valuable information in the process.
To address this problem, we propose a new framework for dynamical system learning, using the
idea of instrumental-variable regression [4, 5] to transform dynamical system learning to a sequence
of ordinary supervised learning problems. This transformation allows us to apply the rich literature
on supervised learning to incorporate many types of prior knowledge. Our new methods subsume a
variety of existing spectral algorithms as special cases.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: first we formulate the new learning framework
(Sec. 2). We then provide theoretical guarantees for the proposed methods (Sec. 4). Finally, we give

two examples of how our techniques let us rapidly design new and useful dynamical system learning
methods by encoding modeling assumptions (Sec. 5).
2 A framework for spectral algorithms
A dynamical system is a stochastic process (i.e., a distribution over sequences of observations) such
that, at any time, the distribution of future observations is fully determined by a vector st called the
latent state. The process is specified by three distributions: the initial state distribution P (s1), the
state transition distribution P (st+1 | st), and the observation distribution P (ot | st). For later use,
we write the observation ot as a function of the state st and random noise t, as shown in Figure 1.
Given a dynamical system, one of the fundamental tasks is to perform inference, where we predict
future observations given a history of observations. Typically this is accomplished by maintaining
a distribution or belief over states bt|t−1 = P (st | o1:t−1) where o1:t−1 denotes the first t − 1
observations. bt|t−1 represents both our knowledge and our uncertainty about the true state of the
system. Two core inference tasks are filtering and prediction.1 In filtering, given the current belief
bt = bt|t−1 and a new observation ot, we calculate an updated belief bt+1 = bt+1|t that incorporates
ot. In prediction, we project our belief into the future: given a belief bt|t−1 we estimate bt+k|t−1 =
P (st+k | o1:t−1) for some k > 0 (without incorporating any intervening observations).
The typical approach for learning a dynamical system is to explicitly learn the initial, transition, and
observation distributions by maximum likelihood. Spectral algorithms offer an alternate approach
to learning: they instead use the method of moments to set up a system of equations that can be
solved in closed form to recover estimates of the desired parameters. In this process, they typically
factorize a matrix or tensor of observed moments—hence the name “spectral.”
Spectral algorithms often (but not always [6]) avoid explicitly estimating the latent state or the initial,
transition, or observation distributions; instead they recover observable operators that can be used
to perform filtering and prediction directly. To do so, they use an observable representation: instead
of maintaining a belief bt over states st, they maintain the expected value of a sufficient statistic of
future observations. Such a representation is often called a (transformed) predictive state [7].
In more detail, we define qt = qt|t−1 = E[ψt | o1:t−1], where ψt = ψ(ot:t+k−1) is a vector of future
features. The features are chosen such that qt determines the distribution of future observations
1There are other forms of inference in addition to filtering and prediction, such as smoothing and likelihood
evaluation, but they are outside the scope of this paper.
2
P (ot:t+k−1 | o1:t−1).2 Filtering then becomes the process of mapping a predictive state qt to qt+1
conditioned on ot, while prediction maps a predictive state qt = qt|t−1 to qt+k|t−1 = E[ψt+k |
o1:t−1] without intervening observations.
A typical way to derive a spectral method is to select a set of moments involving ψt, work out the
expected values of these moments in terms of the observable operators, then invert this relationship
to get an equation for the observable operators in terms of the moments. We can then plug in an
empirical estimate of the moments to compute estimates of the observable operators.
While effective, this approach can be statistically inefficient (the goal of being able to solve for the
observable operators is in conflict with the goal of maximizing statistical efficiency) and can make
it difficult to incorporate prior information (each new source of information leads to new moments
and a different and possibly harder set of equations to solve). To address these problems, we show
that we can instead learn the observable operators by solving three supervised learning problems.
The main idea is that, just as we can represent a belief about a latent state st as the conditional
expectation of a vector of observable statistics, we can also represent any other distributions needed
for prediction and filtering via their own vectors of observable statistics. Given such a representation,
we can learn to filter and predict by learning how to map these vectors to one another.
In particular, the key intermediate quantity for filtering is the “extended and marginalized” belief
P (ot, st+1 | o1:t−1)—or equivalently P (ot:t+k | o1:t−1). We represent this distribution via a vector
ξt = ξ(ot:t+k) of features of the extended future. The features are chosen such that the extended
state pt = E[ξt | o1:t−1] determines P (ot:t+k | o1:t−1). Given P (ot:t+k | o1:t−1), filtering and
prediction reduce respectively to conditioning on and marginalizing over ot.
In many models (including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Kalman filters), the extended state
pt is linearly related to the predictive state qt—a property we exploit for our framework. That is,
pt = Wqt (1)
for some linear operator W . For example, in a discrete system ψt can be an indicator vector repre-
senting the joint assignment of the next k observations, and ξt can be an indicator vector for the next
k + 1 observations. The matrix W is then the conditional probability table P (ot:t+k | ot:t+k−1).
Our goal, therefore, is to learn this mapping W . Naı̈vely, we might try to use linear regression for
this purpose, substituting samples of ψt and ξt in place of qt and pt since we cannot observe qt or
pt directly. Unfortunately, due to the overlap between observation windows, the noise terms on ψt
and ξt are correlated. So, naı̈ve linear regression will give a biased estimate of W .
To counteract this bias, we employ instrumental regression [4, 5]. Instrumental regression uses in-
strumental variables that are correlated with the input qt but not with the noise t:t+k. This property
provides a criterion to denoise the inputs and outputs of the original regression problem: we remove
that part of the input/output that is not correlated with the instrumental variables. In our case, since
past observations o1:t−1 do not overlap with future or extended future windows, they are not cor-
related with the noise t:t+k+1, as can be seen in Figure 1. Therefore, we can use history features
ht = h(o1:t−1) as instrumental variables.
In more detail, by taking the expectation of (1) given ht, we obtain an instrument-based moment
condition: for all t,
E[pt | ht] = E[Wqt | ht]
E[E[ξt | o1:t−1] | ht] = WE[E[ψt | o1:t−1] | ht]
E[ξt | ht] = WE[ψt | ht] (2)
Assuming that there are enough independent dimensions in ht that are correlated with qt, we main-
tain the rank of the moment condition when moving from (1) to (2), and we can recover W by least
squares regression if we can compute E[ψt | ht] and E[ξt | ht] for sufficiently many examples t.
Fortunately, conditional expectations such as E[ψt | ht] are exactly what supervised learning algo-
rithms are designed to compute. So, we arrive at our learning framework: we first use supervised
2For convenience we assume that the system is k-observable: that is, the distribution of all future obser-
vations is determined by the distribution of the next k observations. (Note: not by the next k observations
themselves.) At the cost of additional notation, this restriction could easily be lifted.

learning to estimate E[ψt | ht] and E[ξt | ht], effectively denoising the training examples, and then
use these estimates to compute W by finding the least squares solution to (2).
In summary, learning and inference of a dynamical system through instrumental regression can be
described as follows:
• Model Specification: Pick features of history ht = h(o1:t−1), future ψt = ψ(ot:t+k−1)
and extended future ξt = ξ(ot:t+k). ψt must be a sufficient statistic for P(ot:t+k−1 |
o1:t−1). ξt must satisfy
– E[ψt+1 | o1:t−1] = fpredict(E[ξt | o1:t−1]) for a known function fpredict.
– E[ψt+1 | o1:t] = ffilter(E[ξt | o1:t−1], ot) for a known function ffilter.
• S1A (Stage 1A) Regression: Learn a (possibly non-linear) regression model to estimate
ψ̄t = E[ψt | ht]. The training data for this model are (ht, ψt) across time steps t.3
• S1B Regression: Learn a (possibly non-linear) regression model to estimate ξ̄t = E[ξt |
ht]. The training data for this model are (ht, ξt) across time steps t.
• S2 Regression: Use the feature expectations estimated in S1A and S1B to train a model
to predict ξ̄t = Wψ̄t, where W is a linear operator. The training data for this model are
estimates of (ψ̄t, ξ̄t) obtained from S1A and S1B across time steps t.
• Initial State Estimation: Estimate an initial state q1 = E[ψ1] by averaging ψ1 across
several example realizations of our time series.4
• Inference: Starting from the initial state q1, we can maintain the predictive state qt =
E[ψt | o1:t−1] through filtering: given qt we compute pt = E[ξt | o1:t−1] = Wqt. Then,
given the observation ot, we can compute qt+1 = ffilter(pt, ot). Or, in the absence of ot,
we can predict the next state qt+1|t−1 = fpredict(pt). Finally, by definition, the predictive
state qt is sufficient to compute P(ot:t+k−1 | o1:t−1).5
The process of learning and inference is depicted in Figure 2. Modeling assumptions are reflected
in the choice of the statistics ψ, ξ and h as well as the regression models in stages S1A and S1B.
Table 1 demonstrates that we can recover existing spectral algorithms for dynamical system learning
using linear S1 regression. In addition to providing a unifying view of some successful learning
algorithms, the new framework also paves the way for extending these algorithms in a theoretically
justified manner, as we demonstrate in the experiments below.
3Our bounds assume that the training time steps t are sufficiently spaced for the underlying process to mix,
but in practice, the error will only get smaller if we consider all time steps t.

5It might seem reasonable to learn qt+1 = fcombined(qt, ot) directly, thereby avoiding the need to separately
estimate pt and condition on ot. Unfortunately, fcombined is nonlinear for common models such as HMMs.

3 Related Work
This work extends predictive state learning algorithms for dynamical systems, which include spec-
tral algorithms for Kalman filters [11], Hidden Markov Models [3, 12], Predictive State Represen-
tations (PSRs) [13, 14] and Weighted Automata [15]. It also extends kernel variants such as [9],
which builds on [16]. All of the above work effectively uses linear regression or linear ridge regres-
sion (although not always in an obvious way).
One common aspect of predictive state learning algorithms is that they exploit the covariance struc-
ture between future and past observation sequences to obtain an unbiased observable state represen-
tation. Boots and Gordon [17] note the connection between this covariance and (linear) instrumental
regression in the context of the HSE-HMM. We use this connection to build a general framework for
dynamical system learning where the state space can be identified using arbitrary (possibly nonlin-
ear) supervised learning methods. This generalization lets us incorporate prior knowledge to learn
compact or regularized models; our experiments demonstrate that this flexibility lets us take better
advantage of limited data.
Reducing the problem of learning dynamical systems with latent state to supervised learning bears
similarity to Langford et al.’s sufficient posterior representation (SPR) [18], which encodes the state
by the sufficient statistics of the conditional distribution of the next observation and represents sys-
tem dynamics by three vector-valued functions that are estimated using supervised learning ap-
proaches. While SPR allows all of these functions to be non-linear, it involves a rather complicated
training procedure involving multiple iterations of model refinement and model averaging, whereas
our framework only requires solving three regression problems in sequence. In addition, the theo-
retical analysis of [18] only establishes the consistency of SPR learning assuming that all regression
steps are solved perfectly. Our work, on the other hand, establishes convergence rates based on the
performance of S1 regression.
4 Theoretical Analysis
In this section we present error bounds for two-stage instrumental regression. These bounds hold
regardless of the particular S1 regression method used, assuming that the S1 predictions converge to
the true conditional expectations. The bounds imply that our overall method is consistent.
Let (xt, yt, zt) ∈ (X ,Y,Z) be i.i.d. triplets of input, output, and instrumental variables. (Lack of
independence will result in slower convergence in proportion to the mixing time of our process.) Let
x̄t and ȳt denote E[xt | zt] and E[yt | zt]. And, let x̂t and ŷt denote Ê[xt | zt] and Ê[yt | zt] as
estimated by the S1A and S1B regression steps. Here x̄t, x̂t ∈ X and ȳt, ŷt ∈ Y .
We want to analyze the convergence of the output of S2 regression—that is, of the weights W given
by ridge regression between S1A outputs and S1B outputs:
Ŵλ =
(
T∑
t=1
ŷt ⊗ x̂t
)(
T∑
t=1
x̂t ⊗ x̂t + λIX
)−1
(3)
Here ⊗ denotes tensor (outer) product, and λ > 0 is a regularization parameter that ensures the
invertibility of the estimated covariance.
Before we state our main theorem we need to quantify the quality of S1 regression in a way that is
independent of the S1 functional form. To do so, we place a bound on the S1 error, and assume that
this bound converges to zero: given the definition below, for each fixed δ, limN→∞ ηδ,N = 0.
Definition 1 (S1 Regression Bound). For any δ > 0 andN ∈ N+, the S1 regression bound ηδ,N > 0
is a number such that, with probability at least (1− δ/2), for all 1 ≤ t ≤ N :
‖x̂t − x̄t‖X < ηδ,N
‖ŷt − ȳt‖Y < ηδ,N
In many applications, X , Y and Z will be finite dimensional real vector spaces: Rdx , Rdy and
Rdz . However, for generality we state our results in terms of arbitrary reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces. In this case S2 uses kernel ridge regression, leading to methods such as HSE-PSRs. For
5
this purpose, let Σx̄x̄ and Σȳȳ denote the (uncentered) covariance operators of x̄ and ȳ respectively:
Σx̄x̄ = E[x̄⊗ x̄], Σȳȳ = E[ȳ ⊗ ȳ]. And, letR(Σx̄x̄) denote the closure of the range of Σx̄x̄.
With the above assumptions, Theorem 2 gives a generic error bound on S2 regression in terms of
S1 regression. If X and Y are finite dimensional and Σx̄x̄ has full rank, then using ordinary least
squares (i.e., setting λ = 0) will give the same bound, but with λ in the first two terms replaced by
the minimum eigenvalue of Σx̄x̄, and the last term dropped.
Theorem 2. Assume that ‖x̄‖X , ‖x̄‖Y < c < ∞ almost surely. Assume W is a Hilbert-Schmidt
operator, and let Ŵλ be as defined in (3). Then, with probability at least 1 − δ, for each xtest ∈
R(Σx̄x̄) s.t. ‖xtest‖X ≤ 1, the error ‖Ŵλxtest −Wxtest‖Y is bounded by

We defer the proof to the supplementary material. The supplementary material also provides explicit
finite-sample bounds (including expressions for the constants hidden by O-notation), as well as
concrete examples of S1 regression bounds ηδ,N for practical regression models.
Theorem 2 assumes that xtest is in R(Σx̄x̄). For dynamical systems, all valid states satisfy this
property. However, with finite data, estimation errors may cause the estimated state q̂t (i.e., xtest) to
have a non-zero component inR⊥(Σx̄x̄). Lemma 3 bounds the effect of such errors: it states that, in
a stable system, this component gets smaller as S1 regression performs better. The main limitation
of Lemma 3 is the assumption that ffilter is L-Lipchitz, which essentially means that the model’s
estimated probability for ot is bounded below. There is no way to guarantee this property in practice;
so, Lemma 3 provides suggestive evidence rather than a guarantee that our learned dynamical system
will predict well.
Lemma 3. For observations o1:T , let q̂t be the estimated state given o1:t−1. Let q̃t be the projection
of q̂t onto R(Σx̄x̄). Assume ffilter is L-Lipchitz on pt when evaluated at ot, and ffilter(pt, ot) ∈
R(Σx̄x̄) for any pt ∈ R(Σȳȳ). Given the assumptions of theorem 2 and assuming that ‖q̂t‖X ≤ R
for all 1 ≤ t ≤ T , the following holds for all 1 ≤ t ≤ T with probability at least 1− δ/2.
‖t‖X = ‖q̂t − q̃t‖X = O

Since Ŵλ is bounded, the prediction error due to t diminishes at the same rate as ‖t‖X .
5 Experiments and Results
We now demonstrate examples of tweaking the S1 regression to gain advantage. In the first experi-
ment we show that nonlinear regression can be used to reduce the number of parameters needed in
S1, thereby improving statistical performance for learning an HMM. In the second experiment we
show that we can encode prior knowledge as regularization.
5.1 Learning A Knowledge Tracing Model
In this experiment we attempt to model and predict the performance of students learning from an
interactive computer-based tutor. We use the Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) model [19], which
is essentially a 2-state HMM: the state st represents whether a student has learned a knowledge
component (KC), and the observation ot represents the success/failure of solving the tth question in
a sequence of questions that cover this KC. Figure 3 summarizes the model. The events denoted by
guessing, slipping, learning and forgetting typically have relatively low probabilities.
5.1.1 Data Description

students in 12 knowledge components. As is typical for BKT, we consider a student’s attempt at a
question to be correct iff the student entered the correct answer on the first try, without requesting
any hints from the help system. Each training sequence consists of a sequence of first attempts for a
student/KC pair. We discard sequences of length less than 5, resulting in a total of 325 sequences.
5.1.2 Models and Evaluation
Under the (reasonable) assumption that the two states have distinct observation probabilities, this
model is 1-observable. Hence we define the predictive state to be the expected next observation,
which results in the following statistics: ψt = ot and ξt = ot ⊗k ot+1, where ot is represented by
a 2 dimensional indicator vector and ⊗k denotes the Kronecker product. Given these statistics, the
extended state pt = E[ξt | o1:t−1] is a joint probability table of ot:t+1.
We compare three models that differ by history features and S1 regression method:
Spec-HMM: This baseline uses ht = ot−1 and linear S1 regression, making it equivalent to the
spectral HMM method of [3], as detailed in the supplementary material.
Feat-HMM: This baseline represents ht by an indicator vector of the joint assignment of the previ-
ous b observations (we set b to 4) and uses linear S1 regression. This is essentially a feature-based
spectral HMM [12]. It thus incorporates more history information compared to Spec-HMM at the
expense of increasing the number of S1 parameters by O(2b).
LR-HMM: This model represents ht by a binary vector of length b encoding the previous b obser-
vations and uses logistic regression as the S1 model. Thus, it uses the same history information as
Feat-HMM but reduces the number of parameters to O(b) at the expense of inductive bias.
We evaluated the above models using 1000 random splits of the 325 sequences into 200 training
and 125 testing. For each testing observation ot we compute the absolute error between actual and
expected value (i.e. |δot=1 − P̂ (ot = 1 | o1:t−1)|). We report the mean absolute error for each split.
The results are displayed in Figure 4.6 We see that, while incorporating more history information
increases accuracy (Feat-HMM vs. Spec-HMM), being able to incorporate the same information
using a more compact model gives an additional gain in accuracy (LR-HMM vs. Feat-HMM). We
also compared the LR-HMM method to an HMM trained using expectation maximization (EM). We
found that the LR-HMM model is much faster to train than EM while being on par with it in terms
of prediction error.7
5.2 Modeling Independent Subsystems Using Lasso Regression
Spectral algorithms for Kalman filters typically use the left singular vectors of the covariance be-
tween history and future features as a basis for the state space. However, this basis hides any sparsity
that might be present in our original basis. In this experiment, we show that we can instead use
lasso (without dimensionality reduction) as our S1 regression algorithm to discover sparsity. This is
useful, for example, when the system consists of multiple independent subsystems, each of which
affects a subset of the observation coordinates.
6The differences have similar sign but smaller magnitude if we use RMSE instead of MAE.
7We used MATLAB’s built-in logistic regression and EM functions.

of state dimension 5. Dimensions 21-30 are generated from white noise. Each subsystem’s transi-
tion and observation matrices have random Gaussian coordinates, with the transition matrix scaled
to have a maximum eigenvalue of 0.95. States and observations are perturbed by Gaussian noise
with covariance of 0.01I and 1.0I respectively.
We estimate the state space basis using 1000 examples (assuming 1-observability) and compare the
singular vectors of the past to future regression matrix to those obtained from the Lasso regression
matrix. The result is shown in figure 5. Clearly, using Lasso as stage 1 regression results in a basis
that better matches the structure of the underlying system.
6 Conclusion
In this work we developed a general framework for dynamical system learning using supervised
learning methods. The framework relies on two key principles: first, we extend the idea of predictive
state to include extended state as well, allowing us to represent all of inference in terms of predictions
of observable features. Second, we use past features as instruments in an instrumental regression,
denoising state estimates that then serve as training examples to estimate system dynamics.
We have shown that this framework encompasses and provides a unified view of some previous
successful dynamical system learning algorithms. We have also demostrated that it can be used
to extend existing algorithms to incorporate nonlinearity and regularizers, resulting in better state
estimates. As future work, we would like to apply this framework to leverage additional techniques
such as manifold embedding and transfer learning in stage 1 regression. We would also like to
extend the framework to controlled processes.
