Abstract
Latent models are a fundamental modeling tool in machine learning applications,
but they present significant computational and analytical challenges. The popular
EM algorithm and its variants, is a much used algorithmic tool; yet our rigorous
understanding of its performance is highly incomplete. Recently, work in [1] has
demonstrated that for an important class of problems, EM exhibits linear local
convergence. In the high-dimensional setting, however, the M -step may not be
well defined. We address precisely this setting through a unified treatment using
regularization. While regularization for high-dimensional problems is by now
well understood, the iterative EM algorithm requires a careful balancing of making
progress towards the solution while identifying the right structure (e.g., sparsity or
low-rank). In particular, regularizing the M -step using the state-of-the-art high-
dimensional prescriptions (e.g., à la [19]) is not guaranteed to provide this balance.
Our algorithm and analysis are linked in a way that reveals the balance between
optimization and statistical errors. We specialize our general framework to sparse
gaussian mixture models, high-dimensional mixed regression, and regression with
missing variables, obtaining statistical guarantees for each of these examples.
1 Introduction
We give general conditions for the convergence of the EM method for high-dimensional estimation.
We specialize these conditions to several problems of interest, including high-dimensional sparse
and low-rank mixed regression, sparse gaussian mixture models, and regression with missing covari-
ates. As we explain below, the key problem in the high-dimensional setting is the M -step. A natural
idea is to modify this step via appropriate regularization, yet choosing the appropriate sequence of
regularizers is a critical problem. As we know from the theory of regularized M-estimators (e.g.,
[19]) the regularizer should be chosen proportional to the target estimation error. For EM, however,
the target estimation error changes at each step.
The main contribution of our work is technical: we show how to perform this iterative regularization.
We show that the regularization sequence must be chosen so that it converges to a quantity controlled
by the ultimate estimation error. In existing work, the estimation error is given by the relationship
between the population and empirical M -step operators, but this too is not well defined in the high-
dimensional setting. Thus a key step, related both to our algorithm and its convergence analysis, is
obtaining a different characterization of statistical error for the high-dimensional setting.
Background and Related Work
EM (e.g., [8, 12]) is a general algorithmic approach for handling latent variable models (including
mixtures), popular largely because it is typically computationally highly scalable, and easy to im-
plement. On the flip side, despite a fairly long history of studying EM in theory (e.g., [12, 17, 21]),
1
very little has been understood about general statistical guarantees until recently. Very recent work
in [1] establishes a general local convergence theorem (i.e., assuming initialization lies in a lo-
cal region around true parameter) and statistical guarantees for EM, which is then specialized to
obtain near-optimal rates for several specific low-dimensional problems – low-dimensional in the
sense of the classical statistical setting where the samples outnumber the dimension. A central chal-
lenge in extending EM (and as a corollary, the analysis in [1]) to the high-dimensional regime is
the M -step. On the algorithm side, the M -step will not be stable (or even well-defined in some
cases) in the high-dimensional setting. To make matters worse, any analysis that relies on showing
that the finite-sample M -step is somehow “close” to the M -step performed with infinite data (the
population-level M -step) simply cannot apply in the high-dimensional regime. Recent work in [20]
treats high-dimensional EM using a truncatedM -step. This works in some settings, but also requires
specialized treatment for every different setting, precisely because of the difficulty with the M -step.
In contrast to work in [20], we pursue a high-dimensional extension via regularization. The central
challenge, as mentioned above, is in picking the sequence of regularization coefficients, as this
must control the optimization error (related to the special structure of β∗), as well as the statistical
error. Finally, we note that for finite mixture regression, Städler et al.[16] consider an `1 regularized
EM algorithm for which they develop some asymptotic analysis and oracle inequality. However,
this work doesn’t establish the theoretical properties of local optima arising from regularized EM.
Our work addresses this issue from a local convergence perspective by using a novel choice of
regularization.
2 Classical EM and Challenges in High Dimensions
The EM algorithm is an iterative algorithm designed to combat the non-convexity of max likelihood
due to latent variables. For space concerns we omit the standard derivation, and only give the
definitions we need in the sequel. Let Y ,Z be random variables taking values in Y ,Z , with joint
distribution fβ(y, z) depending on model parameter β ⊆ Ω ⊆ Rp. We observe samples of Y but not
of the latent variable Z. EM seeks to maximize a lower bound on the maximum likelihood function
for β. Letting κβ(z|y) denote the conditional distribution ofZ given Y = y, letting yβ∗(y) denote
the marginal distribution of Y , and defining the function
Qn(β
′|β) := 1
n
n∑
i=1
∫
Z
κβ(z|yi) log fβ′(yi, z)dz, (2.1)
one iteration of the EM algorithm, mapping β(t) to β(t+1), consists of the following two steps:
• E-step: Compute function Qn(β|β(t)) given β(t).
• M-step: β(t+1) ←Mn(β) := arg maxβ′∈ΩQn(β′|β(t)).
We can define the population (infinite sample) versions of Qn andMn in a natural manner:
Q(β′|β) :=
∫
Y
yβ∗(y)
∫
Z
κβ(z|y) log fβ′(y, z)dzdy (2.2)
M(β) = arg max
β′∈Ω
Q(β′|β). (2.3)
This paper is about the high-dimensional setting where the number of samples n may be far less
than the dimensionality p of the parameter β, but where β exhibits some special structure, e.g., it
may be a sparse vector or a low-rank matrix. In such a setting, the M -step of the EM algorithm may
be highly problematic. In many settings, for example sparse mixed regression, the M -step may not
even be well defined. More generally, when n p,Mn(β) may be far from the population version,
M(β), and in particular, the minimum estimation error ‖Mn(β∗) −M(β∗)‖ can be much larger
than the signal strength ‖β∗‖. This quantity is used in [1] as well as in follow-up work in [20], as a
measure of statistical error. In the high dimensional setting, something else is needed.
3 Algorithm
The basis of our algorithm is the by-now well understood concept of regularized high dimensional
estimators, where the regularization is tuned to the underlying structure of β∗, thus defining a regu-
2
larized M -step via
Mrn(β) := arg max
β′∈Ω
Qn(β
′|β)− λnR(β′), (3.1)
where R(·) denotes an appropriate regularizer chosen to match the structure of β∗. The key chal-
lenge is how to choose the sequence of regularizers {λ(t)n } in the iterative process, so as to control
optimization and statistical error. As detailed in Algorithm 1, our sequence of regularizers attempts
to match the target estimation error at each step of the EM iteration. For an intuition of what this
might look like, consider the estimation error at step t: ‖Mrn(β(t)) − β∗‖2. By the triangle in-
equality, we can bound this by a sum of two terms: the optimization error and the final estimation
error:
‖Mrn(β(t))− β∗‖2 ≤ ‖Mrn(β(t))−Mrn(β∗)‖2 + ‖Mrn(β∗)− β∗‖2. (3.2)
Since we expect (and show) linear convergence of the optimization, it is natural to update λ(t)n via a
recursion of the form λ(t)n = κλ
(t−1)
n +∆ as in (3.3), where the first term represents the optimization
error, and ∆ represents the final statistical error, i.e., the last term above in (3.2). A key part of our
analysis shows that this error (and hence ∆) is controlled by ‖∇Qn(β∗|β)−∇Q(β∗|β)‖R∗ , which
in turn can be bounded uniformly for a variety of important applications of EM, including the three
discussed in this paper (see Section 5). While a technical point, it is this key insight that enables
the right choice of algorithm and its analysis. In the cases we consider, we obtain min-max optimal
rates of convergence, demonstrating that no algorithm, let alone another variant of EM, can perform
better.

4 Statistical Guarantees
We now turn to the theoretical analysis of regularized EM algorithm. We first set up a general
analytical framework for regularized EM where the key ingredients are decomposable regularizer
and several technical conditions on the population based Q(·|·) and the sample based Qn(·|·). In
Section 4.3, we provide our main result (Theorem 1) that characterizes both computational and
statistical performance of the proposed variant of regularized EM algorithm.
4.1 Decomposable Regularizers
Decomposable regularizers (e.g., [3, 6, 14, 19]), have been shown to be useful both empirically and
theoretically for high dimensional structural estimation, and they also play an important role in our
analytical framework. Recall that for R : Rp → R+ a norm, and a pair of subspaces (S,S) in Rp
such that S ⊆ S, we have the following definition:
Definition 1 (Decomposability). RegularizerR : Rp → R+ is decomposable with respect to (S,S)
if
R(u + v) = R(u) +R(v), for any u ∈ S,v ∈ S⊥.
Typically, the structure of model parameter β∗ can be characterized by specifying a subspace S such
that β∗ ∈ S . The common use of a regularizer is thus to penalize the compositions of solution that
3
live outside S. We are interested in bounding the estimation error in some norm ‖ · ‖. The following
quantity is critical in connectingR to ‖ · ‖.
Definition 2 (Subspace Compatibility Constant). For any subspace S ⊆ Rp, a given regularizer R
and some norm ‖ · ‖, the subspace compatibility constant of S with respect toR, ‖ · ‖ is given by
Ψ(S) := sup
u∈S\{0}
R(u)
‖u‖
.
As is standard, the dual norm ofR is defined asR∗(v) := supR(u)≤1
〈
u,v
〉
. To simplify notation,
we let ‖u‖R := R(u) and ‖u‖R∗ := R∗(u).
4.2 Conditions on Q(·|·) and Qn(·|·)
Next, we review three technical conditions, originally proposed by [1], on the population levelQ(·|·)
function, and then we give two important conditions that the empirial function Qn(·|·) must satisfy,
including one that characterizes the statistical error.
It is well known that performance of EM algorithm is sensitive to initialization. Following the low-
dimensional development in [1], our results are local, and apply to an r-neighborhood region around
β∗: B(r;β∗) :=
{
u ∈ Ω, ‖u− β∗‖ ≤ r
}
.
We first require that Q(·|β∗) is self consistent as stated below. This is satisfied, in particular, when
β∗ maximizes the population log likelihood function, as happens in most settings of interest [12].
Condition 1 (Self Consistency). Function Q(·|β∗) is self consistent, namely
β∗ = arg max
β∈Ω
Q(β|β∗).
We also require that the function Q(·|·) satisfies a certain strong concavity condition and is smooth
over Ω.
Condition 2 (Strong Concavity and Smoothness (γ, µ, r)). Q(·|β∗) is γ-strongly concave over Ω,
i.e.,
Q(β2|β∗)−Q(β1|β∗)−
〈
∇Q(β1|β∗),β2 − β1
〉
≤ −γ
2
‖β2 − β1‖2, ∀ β1,β2 ∈ Ω. (4.1)
For any β ∈ B(r;β∗), Q(·|β) is µ-smooth over Ω, i.e.,
Q(β2|β)−Q(β1|β)−
〈
∇Q(β1|β),β2 − β1
〉
≥ −µ
2
‖β2 − β1‖2, ∀ β1,β2 ∈ Ω. (4.2)
The next condition is key in guaranteeing the curvature of Q(·|β) is similar to that of Q(·|β∗) when
β is close to β∗. It has also been called First Order Stability in [1].
Condition 3 (Gradient Stability (τ, r)). For any β ∈ B(r;β∗), we have∥∥∇Q(M(β)|β)−∇Q(M(β)|β∗)∥∥ ≤ τ‖β − β∗‖.
The above condition only requires that the gradient be stable at one pointM(β). This is sufficient
for our analysis. In fact, for many concrete examples, one can verify a stronger version of Condition
3 that is
∥∥∇Q(β′|β)−∇Q(β′|β∗)∥∥ ≤ τ‖β − β∗‖, ∀ β′ ∈ B(r;β∗).
Next we require two conditions on the empirical function Qn(·|·), which is computed from finite
number of samples according to (2.1). Our first condition, parallel to Condition 2, imposes a cur-
vature constraint on Qn(·|·). In order to guarantee that the estimation error ‖β(t) − β∗‖ in step t
of the EM algorithm is well controlled, we would like Qn(·|β(t−1)) to be strongly concave at β∗.
However, in the setting where n p, there might exist directions along which Qn(·|β(t−1)) is flat,
e.g., as in mixed linear regression and missing covariate regression. In contrast with Condition 2, we
only require Qn(·|·) to be strongly concave over a particular set C(S,S;R) that is defined in terms
of the subspace pair (S,S) and regularizerR. This set is defined as follows:
C(S,S;R) :=
{
u ∈ Rp :
∥∥ΠS⊥(u)∥∥R ≤ 2 · ∥∥ΠS(u)∥∥R + 2 ·Ψ(S) · ∥∥u∥∥}, (4.3)
where the projection operator ΠS : Rp → Rp is defined as ΠS(u) := arg minv∈S ‖v − u‖. The
restricted strong concavity (RSC) condition is as follows.
4
Condition 4 (RSC (γn,S,S, r, δ)). For any fixed β ∈ B(r;β∗), with probability at least 1− δ, we
have that for all β′ − β∗ ∈ Ω
⋂
C(S,S;R),
Qn(β
′|β)−Qn(β∗|β)−
〈
∇Qn(β∗|β),β′ − β∗
〉
≤ −γn
2
‖β′ − β∗‖2.
The above condition states that Qn(·|β) is strongly concave in directions β′ − β∗ that belong to
C(S,S;R). It is instructive to compare Condition 4 with a related condition proposed by [14] for
analyzing high dimensional M-estimators. They require the loss function to be strongly convex over
the cone {u ∈ Rp : ‖ΠS⊥(u)‖R . ‖ΠS(u)‖R}. Therefore our restrictive set (4.3) is similar to the
cone but has the additional term 2Ψ(S)‖u‖. The main purpose of the term 2Ψ(S)‖u‖ is to allow
the regularization parameter λn to jointly control optimization and statistical error. We note that
while Condition 4 is stronger than the usual RSC condition in M-estimator, in typical settings the
difference is immaterial. This is because
∥∥ΠS(u)∥∥R is within a constant factor of Ψ(S) · ∥∥u∥∥, and
hence checking RSC over C amounts to checking it over ‖ΠS⊥(u)‖R . Ψ(S)‖u‖, which is indeed
what is typically also done in the M-estimator setting.
Finally, we establish the condition that characterizes the achievable statistical error.
Condition 5 (Statistical Error (∆n, r, δ)). For any fixed β ∈ B(r;β∗), with probability at least
1− δ, we have ∥∥∇Qn(β∗|β)−∇Q(β∗|β)∥∥R∗ ≤ ∆n. (4.4)
This quantity replaces the term ‖Mn(β)−M(β)‖which appears in [1] and [20], and which presents
problems in the high dimensional regime.
4.3 Main Results
In this section, we provide the theoretical guarantees for a resampled version of our regularized EM
algorithm: we split the whole dataset into T pieces and use a fresh piece of data in each iteration of
regularized EM. As in [1], resampling makes it possible to check that Conditions 4-5 are satisfied
without requiring them to hold uniformly for all β ∈ B(r;β∗) with high probability. Our empirical
results indicate that it is not in fact required and is an artifact of the analysis. We refer to this
resampled version as Algorithm 2. In the sequel, we letm := n/T to denote the sample complexity
in each iteration. We let α := supu∈Rp\{0} ‖u‖∗/‖u‖, where ‖ · ‖∗ is the dual norm of ‖ · ‖.
For Algorithm 2, our main result is as follows. The proof is deferred to the Supplemental Material.
Theorem 1. Assume the model parameter β∗ ∈ S and regularizerR is decomposable with respect
to (S,S) where S ⊆ S ⊆ Rp. Assume r > 0 is such that B(r;β∗) ⊆ Ω. Further, assume function
Q(·|·), defined in (2.2), is self consistent and satisfies Conditions 2-3 with parameters (γ, µ, r) and
(τ, r). Given n samples and T iterations, let m := n/T . Assume Qm(·|·), computed from any
m i.i.d. samples according to (2.1), satisfies Conditions 4-5 with parameters (γm,S,S, r, 0.5δ/T )
and (∆m, r, 0.5δ/T ). Let κ∗ := 5 αµτγγm , and assume 0 < τ < γ and 0 < κ
∗ ≤ 3/4. Define
∆ := rγm/[60Ψ(S)] and assume ∆m is such that ∆m ≤ ∆.
Consider Algorithm 2 with initialization β(0) ∈ B(r;β∗) and with regularization parameters given
by
λ(t)m = κ

∆, t = 1, 2, . . . , T (4.5)
for any ∆ ∈ [3∆m, 3∆], κ ∈ [κ∗, 3/4]. Then with probability at least 1 − δ, we have that for any
t ∈ [T ],
‖β(t) − β∗‖ ≤ κt‖β(0) − β∗‖+ 5
γm
1− κt
1− κ
Ψ(S)∆. (4.6)
The estimation error is bounded by a term decaying linearly with number of iterations t, which we
can think of as the optimization error and a second term that characterizes the ultimate estimation
error of our algorithm. With T = O(log n) and suitable choice of ∆ such that ∆ = O(∆n/T ), we
bound the ultimate estimation error as
‖β(T ) − β∗‖ . 1
(1− κ)γn/T
Ψ(S)∆n/T . (4.7)
5
We note that overestimating the initial error, ‖β(0)−β∗‖ is not important, as it may slightly increase
the overall number of iterations, but will not impact the ultimate estimation error.
The constraint ∆m . rγm/Ψ(S) ensures that β(t) is contained in B(r;β∗) for all t ∈ [T ]. This
constraint is quite mild in the sense that if ∆m = Ω(rγm/Ψ(S)), β(0) is a decent estimator with
estimation error O(Ψ(S)∆m/γm) that already matches our expectation.
5 Examples: Applying the Theory
Now we introduce three well known latent variable models. For each model, we first review the
standard EM algorithm formulations, and discuss the extensions to the high dimensional setting.
Then we apply Theorem 1 to obtain the statistical guarantee of the regularized EM with data splitting
(Algorithm 2). The key ingredient underlying these results is to check the technical conditions in
Section 4 hold for each model. We postpone these tedious details to the Supplemental Material.
5.1 Gaussian Mixture Model
We consider the balanced isotropic Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with two components where
the distribution of random variables (Y, Z) ∈ Rp × {−1, 1} is characterized as
Pr (Y = y|Z = z) = φ(y; z · β∗, σ2Ip), Pr(Z = 1) = Pr(Z = −1) = 1/2.
Here we use φ(·|µ,Σ) to denote the probability density function of N (µ,Σ). In this example, Z
is the latent variable that indicates the cluster id of each sample. Given n i.i.d. samples {yi}ni=1,
function Qn(·|·) defined in (2.1) corresponds to
QGMMn (β
′|β) = − 1

−1. We assume β∗ ∈
B0(s; p) := {u ∈ Rp : | supp(u)| ≤ s}. Naturally, we choose the regularizer R(·) to be the `1
norm. We define the signal-to-noise ratio SNR := ‖β∗‖2/σ.
Corollary 1 (Sparse Recovery in GMM). There exist constants ρ, C such that if SNR ≥ ρ, n/T ≥
[80C(‖β∗‖∞ + σ)/‖β∗‖2]2 s log p, β(0) ∈ B(‖β∗‖2/4;β∗); then with probability at least 1−T/p

Note that by setting T  log(n/ log p), the order of final estimation error turns out to be

single Gaussian cluster is
√
s log p/n, thereby the rate is optimal on (n, p, s) up to a log factor.
5.2 Mixed Linear Regression
Mixed linear regression (MLR), as considered in some recent work [5, 7, 22], is the problem of
recovering two or more linear vectors from mixed linear measurements. In the case of mixed linear
regression with two symmetric and balanced components, the response-covariate pair (Y,X) ∈
R× Rp is linked through
Y = 〈X, Z · β∗〉+W,
whereW is the noise term andZ is the latent variable that has Rademacher distribution over {−1, 1}.
We assume X ∼ N (0, Ip), W ∼ N (0, σ2). In this setting, with n i.i.d. samples {yi,xi}ni=1 of pair
(Y,X), function Qn(·|·) then corresponds to
QMLRn (β
′|β) = − 1

We consider two kinds of structure on β∗:
Sparse Recovery. Assume β∗ ∈ B0(s; p). Then let R be the `1 norm, as in the previous section.
We define SNR := ‖β∗‖2/σ.
Corollary 2 (Sparse recovery in MLR). There exist constant ρ, C,C ′ such that if SNR ≥ ρ, n/T ≥
C ′ [(‖β∗‖2 + δ)/‖β∗‖2]2 s log p, β(0) ∈ B(‖β∗‖2/240,β∗); then with probability at least 1−T/p

Performing T  log(n/(s log p)) iterations gives us estimation rate (‖β∗‖2 +

(s log p/n) log (n/(s log p)) which is near-optimal on (s, p, n). The dependence on ‖β∗‖2,
which also appears in the analysis of EM in the classical (low dimensional) setting [1], arises from
fundamental limits of EM. Removing such dependence for MLR is possible by convex relaxation
[7]. It is interesting to study how to remove it in the high dimensional setting.
Low Rank Recovery. Second we consider the setting where the model parameter is a matrix Γ∗ ∈
Rp1×p2 with rank(Γ∗) = θ  min(p1, p2). We further assume X ∈ Rp1×p2 is an i.i.d. Gaussian
matrix, i.e., entries of X are independent random variables with distribution N (0, 1). We apply
nuclear norm regularization to serve the low rank structure, i.e, R(Γ) =
∑p1,p2
i=1 |si(Γ)|, where
si(Γ) is the ith singular value of Γ. Similarly, we let SNR := ‖Γ∗‖F /σ.
Corollary 3 (Low rank recovery in MLR). There exist constant ρ, C,C ′ such that if SNR ≥ ρ,
n/T ≥ C ′ [(‖Γ∗‖F + σ)/‖Γ∗‖F ]2 θ(p1 + p2), Γ(0) ∈ B(‖Γ∗‖F /1600,Γ∗); then with probability

The standard low rank matrix recovery with a single component, including other sensing matrix
designs beyond the Gaussianity, has been studied extensively (e.g., [2, 4, 13, 15]). To the best of our
knowledge, the theoretical study of the mixed low rank matrix recovery has not been considered.
5.3 Missing Covariate Regression
As our last example, we consider the missing covariate regression (MCR) problem. To parallel
standard linear regression, {yi,xi}ni=1 are samples of (Y,X) linked through Y = 〈X,β∗〉 + W .
However, we assume each entry of xi is missing independently with probability  ∈ (0, 1). There-
fore, the observed covariate vector x̃i takes the form
x̃i,j =
{
xi,j with probability 1− 
∗ otherwise .
We assume the model is under Gaussian design X ∼ N (0, Ip),W ∼ N (0, σ2). We refer the
reader to our Supplementary Material for the specific Qn(·|·) function. In high dimensional case,
we assume β∗ ∈ B0(s; p). We define ρ := ‖β∗‖2/σ to be the SNR and ω := r/‖β∗‖2 to be the
relative contractivity radius. In particular, let ζ := (1 + ω)ρ.
Corollary 4 (Sparse Recovery in MCR). There exist constantsC,C ′, C0, C1 such that if (1+ω)ρ ≤
C0 < 1,  < C1, n/T ≥ C ′max{σ2(ωρ)−1, 1}s log p, β(0) ∈ B(ω‖β∗‖2,β∗); then with prob-
ability at least 1 − T/p Algorithm 2 with parameters ∆ = Cσ

Unlike the previous two models, we require an upper bound on the signal to noise ratio. This unusual
constraint is in fact unavoidable [10]. By optimizing T , the order of final estimation error turns out
to be σ
√
s log p/n log(n/(s log p)).
6 Simulations
We now provide some simulation results to back up our theory. Note that while Theorem 1 requires
resampling, we believe in practice this is unnecessary. This is validated by our results, where we
apply Algorithm 1 to the four latent variable models discussed in Section 5.
Convergence Rate. We first evaluate the convergence of Algorithm 1 assuming only that the initial-
ization is a bounded distance from β∗. For a given error ω‖β∗‖2, the initial parameter β(0) is picked
randomly from the sphere centered around β∗ with radius ω‖β∗‖2. We use Algorithm 1 with T = 7,
κ = 0.7, λ(0)n in Theorem 1. The choice of the critical parameter ∆ is given in the Supplementary
Material. For every single trial, we report estimation error ‖β(t) − β∗‖2 and optimization error
‖β(t) − β(T )‖2 in every iteration. We plot the log of errors over iteration t in Figure 1.

independent trial. Settings: (a,b,d) (n, p, s) = (500, 800, 5); (d) (n, p, θ) = (600, 30, 3); (a-c)
SNR = 5; (d) (SNR, ) = (0.5, 0.2); (a-d) ω = 0.5.
Statistical Rate. We now evaluate the statistical rate. We set T = 7 and compute estimation error
on β̂ := β(T ). In Figure 2, we plot ‖β̂−β∗‖2 over normalized sample complexity, i.e., n/(s log p)
for s-sparse parameter and n/(θp) for rank θ p-by-p parameter. We refer the reader to Figure 1 for
other settings. We observe that the same normalized sample complexity leads to almost identical
estimation error in practice, which thus supports the corresponding statistical rate established in
Section 5.
