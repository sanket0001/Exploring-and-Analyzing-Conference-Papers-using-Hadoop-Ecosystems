Abstract
We study Nyström type subsampling approaches to large scale kernel methods,
and prove learning bounds in the statistical learning setting, where random sam-
pling and high probability estimates are considered. In particular, we prove that
these approaches can achieve optimal learning bounds, provided the subsampling
level is suitably chosen. These results suggest a simple incremental variant of
Nyström Kernel Regularized Least Squares, where the subsampling level im-
plements a form of computational regularization, in the sense that it controls at
the same time regularization and computations. Extensive experimental analy-
sis shows that the considered approach achieves state of the art performances on
benchmark large scale datasets.
1 Introduction
Kernel methods provide an elegant and effective framework to develop nonparametric statistical
approaches to learning [1]. However, memory requirements make these methods unfeasible when
dealing with large datasets. Indeed, this observation has motivated a variety of computational strate-
gies to develop large scale kernel methods [2–8].
In this paper we study subsampling methods, that we broadly refer to as Nyström approaches. These
methods replace the empirical kernel matrix, needed by standard kernel methods, with a smaller
matrix obtained by (column) subsampling [2, 3]. Such procedures are shown to often dramatically
reduce memory/time requirements while preserving good practical performances [9–12]. The goal
of our study is two-fold. First, and foremost, we aim at providing a theoretical characterization of the
generalization properties of such learning schemes in a statistical learning setting. Second, we wish
to understand the role played by the subsampling level both from a statistical and a computational
point of view. As discussed in the following, this latter question leads to a natural variant of Kernel
Regularized Least Squares (KRLS), where the subsampling level controls both regularization and
computations.
From a theoretical perspective, the effect of Nyström approaches has been primarily character-
ized considering the discrepancy between a given empirical kernel matrix and its subsampled ver-
sion [13–19]. While interesting in their own right, these latter results do not directly yield infor-
mation on the generalization properties of the obtained algorithm. Results in this direction, albeit
suboptimal, were first derived in [20] (see also [21,22]), and more recently in [23,24]. In these latter
papers, sharp error analyses in expectation are derived in a fixed design regression setting for a form
of Kernel Regularized Least Squares. In particular, in [23] a basic uniform sampling approach is
studied, while in [24] a subsampling scheme based on the notion of leverage score is considered.
The main technical contribution of our study is an extension of these latter results to the statistical
learning setting, where the design is random and high probability estimates are considered. The
1
more general setting makes the analysis considerably more complex. Our main result gives opti-
mal finite sample bounds for both uniform and leverage score based subsampling strategies. These
methods are shown to achieve the same (optimal) learning error as kernel regularized least squares,
recovered as a special case, while allowing substantial computational gains. Our analysis highlights
the interplay between the regularization and subsampling parameters, suggesting that the latter can
be used to control simultaneously regularization and computations. This strategy implements a
form of computational regularization in the sense that the computational resources are tailored to
the generalization properties in the data. This idea is developed considering an incremental strat-
egy to efficiently compute learning solutions for different subsampling levels. The procedure thus
obtained, which is a simple variant of classical Nyström Kernel Regularized Least Squares with uni-
form sampling, allows for efficient model selection and achieves state of the art results on a variety
of benchmark large scale datasets.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the setting and algorithms
we consider. In Section 3, we present our main theoretical contributions. In Section 4, we discuss
computational aspects and experimental results.
2 Supervised learning with KRLS and Nyström approaches
LetX×R be a probability space with distribution ρ, where we viewX and R as the input and output
spaces, respectively. Let ρX denote the marginal distribution of ρ on X and ρ(·|x) the conditional
distribution on R given x ∈ X . Given a hypothesis space H of measurable functions from X to R,
the goal is to minimize the expected risk,
min
f∈H
E(f), E(f) =
∫
X×R
(f(x)− y)2dρ(x, y), (1)
provided ρ is known only through a training set of (xi, yi)ni=1 sampled identically and independently
according to ρ. A basic example of the above setting is random design regression with the squared
loss, in which case
yi = f∗(xi) + i, i = 1, . . . , n, (2)
with f∗ a fixed regression function, 1, . . . , n a sequence of random variables seen as noise, and
x1, . . . , xn random inputs. In the following, we consider kernel methods, based on choosing a
hypothesis space which is a separable reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The latter is a Hilbert space
H of functions, with inner product 〈·, ·〉H, such that there exists a function K : X ×X → R with
the following two properties: 1) for all x ∈ X , Kx(·) = K(x, ·) belongs to H, and 2) the so called
reproducing property holds: f(x) = 〈f,Kx〉H, for all f ∈ H, x ∈ X [25]. The function K, called
reproducing kernel, is easily shown to be symmetric and positive definite, that is the kernel matrix
(KN )i,j = K(xi, xj) is positive semidefinite for all x1, . . . , xN ∈ X , N ∈ N. A classical way to
derive an empirical solution to problem (1) is to consider a Tikhonov regularization approach, based
on the minimization of the penalized empirical functional,
min
f∈H
1
n
n∑
i=1
(f(xi)− yi)2 + λ‖f‖2H, λ > 0. (3)
The above approach is referred to as Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) or Kernel Ridge
Regression (KRR). It is easy to see that a solution f̂λ to problem (3) exists, it is unique and the
representer theorem [1] shows that it can be written as
f̂λ(x) =
n∑
i=1
α̂iK(xi, x) with α̂ = (Kn + λnI)−1y, (4)
where x1, . . . , xn are the training set points, y = (y1, . . . , yn) andKn is the empirical kernel matrix.
Note that this result implies that we can restrict the minimization in (3) to the space,
Hn = {f ∈ H | f =
n∑
i=1
αiK(xi, ·), α1, . . . , αn ∈ R}.
Storing the kernel matrix Kn, and solving the linear system in (4), can become computationally
unfeasible as n increases. In the following, we consider strategies to find more efficient solutions,
2
based on the idea of replacingHn with
Hm = {f | f =
m∑
i=1
αiK(x̃i, ·), α ∈ Rm},
where m ≤ n and {x̃1, . . . , x̃m} is a subset of the input points in the training set. The solution f̂λ,m
of the corresponding minimization problem can now be written as,
f̂λ,m(x) =
m∑
i=1
α̃iK(x̃i, x) with α̃ = (K>nmKnm + λnKmm)
†K>nmy, (5)
where A† denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of a matrix A, and (Knm)ij = K(xi, x̃j),
(Kmm)kj = K(x̃k, x̃j) with i ∈ {1, . . . , n} and j, k ∈ {1, . . . ,m} [2]. The above approach is
related to Nyström methods and different approximation strategies correspond to different ways to
select the inputs subset. While our framework applies to a broader class of strategies, see Sec-
tion C.1, in the following we primarily consider two techniques.
Plain Nyström. The points {x̃1, . . . , x̃m} are sampled uniformly at random without replacement
from the training set.
Approximate leverage scores (ALS) Nyström. Recall that the leverage scores associated to the
training set points x1, . . . , xn are
(li(t))
n
i=1, li(t) = (Kn(Kn + tnI)
−1)ii, i ∈ {1, . . . , n} (6)
for any t > 0, where (Kn)ij = K(xi, xj). In practice, leverage scores are onerous to compute
and approximations (l̂i(t))ni=1 can be considered [16, 17, 24] . In particular, in the following we are
interested in suitable approximations defined as follows:
Definition 1 (T -approximate leverage scores). Let (li(t))ni=1 be the leverage scores associated to
the training set for a given t. Let δ > 0, t0 > 0 and T ≥ 1. We say that (l̂i(t))ni=1 are T -approximate
leverage scores with confidence δ, when with probability at least 1− δ,
1
T
li(t) ≤ l̂i(t) ≤ T li(t) ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, t ≥ t0.
Given T -approximate leverage scores for t > λ0, {x̃1, . . . , x̃m} are sampled from the training set in-
dependently with replacement, and with probability to be selected given by Pt(i) = l̂i(t)/
∑
j l̂j(t).
In the next section, we state and discuss our main result showing that the KRLS formulation based on
plain or approximate leverage scores Nyström provides optimal empirical solutions to problem (1).
3 Theoretical analysis
In this section, we state and discuss our main results. We need several assumptions. The first basic
assumption is that problem (1) admits at least a solution.
Assumption 1. There exists an fH ∈ H such that
E(fH) = min
f∈H
E(f).
Note that, while the minimizer might not be unique, our results apply to the case in which fH is the
unique minimizer with minimal norm. Also, note that the above condition is weaker than assuming
the regression function in (2) to belong to H. Finally, we note that the study of the paper can be
adapted to the case in which minimizers do not exist, but the analysis is considerably more involved
and left to a longer version of the paper.
The second assumption is a basic condition on the probability distribution.
Assumption 2. Let zx be the random variable zx = y − fH(x), with x ∈ X , and y distributed
according to ρ(y|x). Then, there exists M,σ > 0 such that E|zx|p ≤ 12p!M
p−2σ2 for any p ≥ 2,
almost everywhere on X .
The above assumption is needed to control random quantities and is related to a noise assumption in
the regression model (2). It is clearly weaker than the often considered bounded output assumption
3
[25], and trivially verified in classification.
The last two assumptions describe the capacity (roughly speaking the “size”) of the hypothesis space
induced by K with respect to ρ and the regularity of fH with respect to K and ρ. To discuss them,
we first need the following definition.
Definition 2 (Covariance operator and effective dimensions). We define the covariance operator as
C : H → H, 〈f, Cg〉H =
∫
X
f(x)g(x)dρX(x) , ∀ f, g ∈ H.
Moreover, for λ > 0, we define the random variable Nx(λ) =
〈
Kx, (C + λI)
−1Kx
〉
H with x ∈ X
distributed according to ρX and let
N (λ) = ENx(λ), N∞(λ) = sup
x∈X
Nx(λ).
We add several comments. Note that C corresponds to the second moment operator, but we refer to
it as the covariance operator with an abuse of terminology. Moreover, note thatN (λ) = Tr(C(C +
λI)−1) (see [26]). This latter quantity, called effective dimension or degrees of freedom, can be seen
as a measure of the capacity of the hypothesis space. The quantity N∞(λ) can be seen to provide a
uniform bound on the leverage scores in Eq. (6). Clearly, N (λ) ≤ N∞(λ) for all λ > 0.
Assumption 3. The kernel K is measurable, C is bounded. Moreover, for all λ > 0 and a Q > 0,
N∞(λ) <∞, (7)
N (λ) ≤ Qλ−γ , 0 < γ ≤ 1. (8)
Measurability of K and boundedness of C are minimal conditions to ensure that the covariance
operator is a well defined linear, continuous, self-adjoint, positive operator [25]. Condition (7) is
satisfied if the kernel is bounded supx∈X K(x, x) = κ
2 < ∞, indeed in this case N∞(λ) ≤ κ2/λ
for all λ > 0. Conversely, it can be seen that condition (7) together with boundedness of C imply
that the kernel is bounded, indeed 1
κ2 ≤ 2‖C‖N∞(‖C‖).
Boundedness of the kernel implies in particular that the operator C is trace class and allows to
use tools from spectral theory. Condition (8) quantifies the capacity assumption and is related to
covering/entropy number conditions (see [25] for further details). In particular, it is known that
condition (8) is ensured if the eigenvalues (σi)i of C satisfy a polynomial decaying condition σi ∼
i−
1
γ . Note that, since the operator C is trace class, Condition (8) always holds for γ = 1. Here,
for space constraints and in the interest of clarity we restrict to such a polynomial condition, but the
analysis directly applies to other conditions including exponential decay or a finite rank conditions
[26]. Finally, we have the following regularity assumption.
Assumption 4. There exists s ≥ 0, 1 ≤ R <∞, such that ‖C−sfH‖H < R.
The above condition is fairly standard, and can be equivalently formulated in terms of classical
concepts in approximation theory such as interpolation spaces [25]. Intuitively, it quantifies the
degree to which fH can be well approximated by functions in the RKHS H and allows to control
the bias/approximation error of a learning solution. For s = 0, it is always satisfied. For larger
s, we are assuming fH to belong to subspaces of H that are the images of the fractional compact
operators Cs. Such spaces contain functions which, expanded on a basis of eigenfunctions of C,
have larger coefficients in correspondence to large eigenvalues. Such an assumption is natural in
view of using techniques such as (4), which can be seen as a form of spectral filtering, that estimate
stable solutions by discarding the contribution of small eigenvalues [27]. In the next section, we
are going to quantify the quality of empirical solutions of Problem (1) obtained by schemes of the
form (5), in terms of the quantities in Assumptions 2, 3, 4.

3.1 Main results
In this section, we state and discuss our main results, starting with optimal finite sample error bounds
for regularized least squares based on plain and approximate leverage score based Nyström subsam-
pling.
Theorem 1. Under Assumptions 1, 2, 3, and 4, let δ > 0, v = min(s, 1/2), p = 1 + 1/(2v + γ)

We add several comments. First, the above results can be shown to be optimal in a minimax sense.
Indeed, minimax lower bounds proved in [26, 28] show that the learning rate in (9) is optimal un-
der the considered assumptions (see Thm. 2, 3 of [26], for a discussion on minimax lower bounds
see Sec. 2 of [26]). Second, the obtained bounds can be compared to those obtained for other reg-
ularized learning techniques. Techniques known to achieve optimal error rates include Tikhonov
regularization [26, 28, 29], iterative regularization by early stopping [30, 31], spectral cut-off regu-
larization (a.k.a. principal component regression or truncated SVD) [30, 31], as well as regularized
stochastic gradient methods [32]. All these techniques are essentially equivalent from a statistical
point of view and differ only in the required computations. For example, iterative methods allow
for a computation of solutions corresponding to different regularization levels which is more effi-
cient than Tikhonov or SVD based approaches. The key observation is that all these methods have
the same O(n2) memory requirement. In this view, our results show that randomized subsampling
methods can break such a memory barrier, and consequently achieve much better time complexity,
while preserving optimal learning guarantees. Finally, we can compare our results with previous
analysis of randomized kernel methods. As already mentioned, results close to those in Theorem 1
are given in [23, 24] in a fixed design setting. Our results extend and generalize the conclusions of
these papers to a general statistical learning setting. Relevant results are given in [8] for a different
approach, based on averaging KRLS solutions obtained splitting the data in m groups (divide and
conquer RLS). The analysis in [8] is only in expectation, but considers random design and shows
that the proposed method is indeed optimal provided the number of splits is chosen depending on
the effective dimension N (λ). This is the only other work we are aware of establishing optimal
learning rates for randomized kernel approaches in a statistical learning setting. In comparison with
Nyström computational regularization the main disadvantage of the divide and conquer approach is
computational and in the model selection phase where solutions corresponding to different regular-
ization parameters and number of splits usually need to be computed.
The proof of Theorem 1 is fairly technical and lengthy. It incorporates ideas from [26] and tech-
niques developed to study spectral filtering regularization [30, 33]. In the next section, we briefly
sketch some main ideas and discuss how they suggest an interesting perspective on regularization
techniques including subsampling.
3.2 Proof sketch and a computational regularization perspective
A key step in the proof of Theorem 1 is an error decomposition, and corresponding bound, for any
fixed λ and m. Indeed, it is proved in Theorem 2 and Proposition 2 that, for δ > 0, with probability

The first and last term in the right hand side of the above inequality can be seen as forms of sample
and approximation errors [25] and are studied in Lemma 4 and Theorem 2. The mid term can be
seen as a computational error and depends on the considered subsampling scheme. Indeed, it is
shown in Proposition 2 that C(m) can be taken as,
Cpl(m) = min
{
t > 0

for the approximate leverage scores approach. The bounds in Theorem 1 follow by: 1) minimizing
in λ the sum of the first and third term 2) choosing m so that the computational error is of the
same order of the other terms. Computational resources and regularization are then tailored to the
generalization properties of the data at hand. We add a few comments. First, note that the error bound
in (10) holds for a large class of subsampling schemes, as discussed in Section C.1 in the appendix.
Then specific error bounds can be derived developing computational error estimates. Second, the
error bounds in Theorem 2 and Proposition 2, and hence in Theorem 1, easily generalize to a larger
class of regularization schemes beyond Tikhonov approaches, namely spectral filtering [30]. For
space constraints, these extensions are deferred to a longer version of the paper. Third, we note that,
in practice, optimal data driven parameter choices, e.g. based on hold-out estimates [31], can be
used to adaptively achieve optimal learning bounds.
Finally, we observe that a different perspective is derived starting from inequality (10), and noting
that the role played by m and λ can also be exchanged. Letting m play the role of a regularization
parameter, λ can be set as a function of m and m tuned adaptively. For example, in the case of a
plain Nyström approach, if we set
λ =
logm
m
, and m = 3n
1
2v+γ+1 log n,
then the obtained learning solution achieves the error bound in Eq. (9). As above, the subsampling
level can also be chosen by cross-validation. Interestingly, in this case by tuning m we naturally
control computational resources and regularization. An advantage of this latter parameterization
is that, as described in the following, the solution corresponding to different subsampling levels is
easy to update using Cholesky rank-one update formulas [34]. As discussed in the next section,
in practice, a joint tuning over m and λ can be done starting from small m and appears to be
advantageous both for error and computational performances.
4 Incremental updates and experimental analysis
In this section, we first describe an incremental strategy to efficiently explore different subsampling
levels and then perform extensive empirical tests aimed in particular at: 1) investigating the sta-
tistical and computational benefits of considering varying subsampling levels, and 2) compare the

performance of the algorithm with respect to state of the art solutions on several large scale bench-
mark datasets. Throughout this section, we only consider a plain Nyström approach, deferring to
future work the analysis of leverage scores based sampling techniques. Interestingly, we will see
that such a basic approach can often provide state of the art performances.
4.1 Efficient incremental updates
Algorithm 1 efficiently compute solutions corresponding to different subsampling levels, by exploit-
ing rank-one Cholesky updates [34]. The proposed procedure allows to efficiently compute a whole
regularization path of solutions, and hence perform fast model selection2 (see Sect. A). In Algo-
rithm 1, the function cholup is the Cholesky rank-one update formula available in many linear
algebra libraries. The total cost of the algorithm is O(nm2 + m3) time to compute α̃2, . . . , α̃m,
while a naive non-incremental algorithm would require O(nm2T +m3T ) with T is the number of
analyzed subsampling levels. The following are some quantities needed by the algorithm: A1 = a1
and At = (At−1 at) ∈ Rn×t, for any 2 ≤ t ≤ m. Moreover, for any 1 ≤ t ≤ m, gt =
√
1 + γt and
ut = (ct/(1 + gt), gt), at = (K(x̃t, x1), . . . ,K(x̃t, xn)), ct = A

4.2 Experimental analysis
We empirically study the properties of Algorithm 1, considering a Gaussian kernel of width σ. The
selected datasets are already divided in a training and a test part3. We randomly split the training
part in a training set and a validation set (80% and 20% of the n training points, respectively) for
parameter tuning via cross-validation. The m subsampled points for Nyström approximation are se-
lected uniformly at random from the training set. We report the performance of the selected model
on the fixed test set, repeating the process for several trials.
Interplay between λ and m. We begin with a set of results showing that incrementally explor-
ing different subsampling levels can yield very good performance while substantially reducing the
computational requirements. We consider the pumadyn32nh (n = 8192, d = 32), the breast
cancer (n = 569, d = 30), and the cpuSmall (n = 8192, d = 12) datasets4. In Figure 1, we
report the validation errors associated to a 20 × 20 grid of values for λ and m. The λ values are
logarithmically spaced, while the m values are linearly spaced. The ranges and kernel bandwidths,
chosen according to preliminary tests on the data, are σ = 2.66, λ ∈
[
10−7, 1
]
, m ∈ [10, 1000] for
pumadyn32nh, σ = 0.9, λ ∈
[
10−12, 10−3
]
, m ∈ [5, 300] for breast cancer, and σ = 0.1,
λ ∈
[
10−15, 10−12
]
, m ∈ [100, 5000] for cpuSmall. The main observation that can be derived
from this first series of tests is that a small m is sufficient to obtain the same results achieved with
the largest m. For example, for pumadyn32nh it is sufficient to choose m = 62 and λ = 10−7
to obtain an average test RMSE of 0.33 over 10 trials, which is the same as the one obtained using
m = 1000 and λ = 10−3, with a 3-fold speedup of the joint training and validation phase. Also,
it is interesting to observe that for given values of λ, large values of m can decrease the perfor-
mance. This observation is consistent with the results in Section 3.1, showing that m can play the

role of a regularization parameter. Similar results are obtained for breast cancer, where for
λ = 4.28 × 10−6 and m = 300 we obtain a 1.24% average classification error on the test set over
20 trials, while for λ = 10−12 and m = 67 we obtain 1.86%. For cpuSmall, with m = 5000 and
λ = 10−12 the average test RMSE over 5 trials is 12.2, while for m = 2679 and λ = 10−15 it is
only slightly higher, 13.3, but computing its associated solution requires less than half of the time
and approximately half of the memory.
Regularization path computation. If the subsampling levelm is used as a regularization parameter,
the computation of a regularization path corresponding to different subsampling levels becomes cru-
cial during the model selection phase. A naive approach, that consists in recomputing the solutions
of Eq. 5 for each subsampling level, would require O(m2nT +m3LT ) computational time, where
T is the number of solutions with different subsampling levels to be evaluated and L is the number
of Tikhonov regularization parameters. On the other hand, by using the incremental Nyström al-
gorithm the model selection time complexity is O(m2n + m3L) for the whole regularization path.
We experimentally verify this speedup on cpuSmall with 10 repetitions, setting m ∈ [1, 5000]
and T = 50. The model selection times, measured on a server with 12 × 2.10GHz Intelr Xeonr
E5-2620 v2 CPUs and 132 GB of RAM, are reported in Figure 2. The result clearly confirms the
beneficial effects of incremental Nyström model selection on the computational time.
Predictive performance comparison. Finally, we consider the performance of the algorithm on
several large scale benchmark datasets considered in [6], see Table 1. σ has been chosen on the
basis of preliminary data analysis. m and λ have been chosen by cross-validation, starting from
small subsampling values up to mmax = 2048, and considering λ ∈
[
10−12, 1
]
. After model se-
lection, we retrain the best model on the entire training set and compute the RMSE on the test set.
We consider 10 trials, reporting the performance mean and standard deviation. The results in Table
1 compare Nyström computational regularization with the following methods (as in [6]):
• Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS): Not compatible with large datasets.
• Random Fourier features (RF): As in [4], with a number of random features D = 2048.
• Fastfood RBF, FFT and Matern kernel: As in [6], with D = 2048 random features.
• Batch Nyström: Nyström method [3] with uniform sampling and m = 2048.
The above results show that the proposed incremental Nyström approach behaves really well, match-
ing state of the art predictive performances.
