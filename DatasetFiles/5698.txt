Abstract
Consider the binary classification problem of predicting a target variable Y from
a discrete feature vector X = (X1, . . . , Xd). When the probability distribution
P(X, Y ) is known, the optimal classifier, leading to the minimum misclassifi-
cation rate, is given by the Maximum A-posteriori Probability (MAP) decision
rule. However, in practice, estimating the complete joint distribution P(X, Y ) is
computationally and statistically impossible for large values of d. Therefore, an
alternative approach is to first estimate some low order marginals of the joint prob-
ability distribution P(X, Y ) and then design the classifier based on the estimated
low order marginals. This approach is also helpful when the complete training
data instances are not available due to privacy concerns.
In this work, we consider the problem of finding the optimum classifier based on
some estimated low order marginals of (X, Y ). We prove that for a given set of
marginals, the minimum Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi (HGR) correlation principle
introduced in [1] leads to a randomized classification rule which is shown to have
a misclassification rate no larger than twice the misclassification rate of the opti-
mal classifier. Then, under a separability condition, it is shown that the proposed
algorithm is equivalent to a randomized linear regression approach. In addition,
this method naturally results in a robust feature selection method selecting a sub-
set of features having the maximum worst case HGR correlation with the target
variable. Our theoretical upper-bound is similar to the recent Discrete Chebyshev
Classifier (DCC) approach [2], while the proposed algorithm has significant com-
putational advantages since it only requires solving a least square optimization
problem. Finally, we numerically compare our proposed algorithm with the DCC
classifier and show that the proposed algorithm results in better misclassification
rate over various UCI data repository datasets.
1 Introduction
Statistical classification, a core task in many modern data processing and prediction problems, is
the problem of predicting labels for a given feature vector based on a set of training data instances
containing feature vectors and their corresponding labels. From a probabilistic point of view, this
problem can be formulated as follows: given data samples (X1, Y 1), . . . , (Xn, Y n) from a proba-
bility distribution P(X, Y ), predict the target label ytest for a given test point X = xtest.
Many modern classification problems are on high dimensional categorical features. For exam-
ple, in the genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the classification task is to predict a trait
of interest based on observations of the SNPs in the genome. In this problem, the feature vector
X = (X1, . . . , Xd) is categorical with Xi ∈ {0, 1, 2}.
What is the optimal classifier leading to the minimum misclassification rate for such a classification
problem with high dimensional categorical feature vectors? When the joint probability distribution
of the random vector (X, Y ) is known, the MAP decision rule defined by δMAP , argmaxy P(Y =

y|X = x) achieves the minimum misclassification rate. However, in practice the joint probability
distribution P(X, Y ) is not known. Moreover, estimating the complete joint probability distribution
is not possible due to the curse of dimensionality. For example, in the above GWAS problem, the
dimension of the feature vector X is d ≈ 3, 000, 000 which leads to the alphabet size of 33,000,000
for the feature vector X. Hence, a practical approach is to first estimate some low order marginals of
P(X, Y ), and then use these low order marginals to build a classifier with low misclassification rate.
This approach, which is the sprit of various machine learning and statistical methods [2–6], is also
useful when the complete data instances are not available due to privacy concerns in applications
such as medical informatics.
In this work, we consider the above problem of building a classifier for a given set of low order
marginals. First, we formally state the problem of finding the robust classifier with the minimum
worst case misclassification rate. Our goal is to find a (possibly randomized) decision rule which has
the minimum worst case misclassification rate over all probability distributions satisfying the given
low order marginals. Then a surrogate objective function, which is obtained by the minimum HGR
correlation principle [1], is used to propose a randomized classification rule. The proposed classifi-
cation method has the worst case misclassification rate no more than twice the misclassification rate
of the optimal classifier. When only pairwise marginals are estimated, it is shown that this classifier
is indeed a randomized linear regression classifier on indicator variables under a separability condi-
tion. Then, we formulate a feature selection problem based on the knowledge of pairwise marginals
which leads to the minimum misclassification rate. Our analysis provides a theoretical justification
for using group lasso objective function for feature selection over the discrete set of features. Finally,
we conclude by presenting numerical experiments comparing the proposed classifier with discrete
Chebyshev classifier [2], Tree Augmented Naive Bayes [3], and Minimax Probabilistic Machine [4].
In short, the contributions of this work is as follows.
• Providing a rigorous theoretical justification for using the minimum HGR correlation prin-
ciple for binary classification problem.
• Proposing a randomized classifier with misclassification rate no larger than twice the mis-
classification rate of the optimal classifier.
• Introducing a computationally efficient method for calculating the proposed randomized
classifier when pairwise marginals are estimated and a separability condition is satisfied.
• Providing a mathematical justification based on maximal correlation for using group lasso
problem for feature selection in categorical data.
Related Work: The idea of learning structures in data through low order marginals/moments is
popular in machine learning and statistics. For example, the maximum entropy principle [7], which
is the spirit of the variational method in graphical models [5] and tree augmented naive Bayes [3],
is based on the idea of fixing the marginal distributions and fitting a probabilistic model which
maximizes the Shannon entropy. Although these methods fit a probabilistic model satisfying the low
order marginals, they do not directly optimize the misclassification rate of the resulting classifier.
Another related information theoretic approach is the minimum mutual information principle [8]
which finds the probability distribution with the minimum mutual information between the feature
vector and the target variable. This approach is closely related to the framework of this paper;
however, unlike the minimum HGR principle, there is no known computationally efficient approach
for calculating the probability distribution with the minimum mutual information.
In the continuous setting, the idea of minimizing the worst case misclassification rate leads to the
minimax probability machine [4]. This algorithm and its analysis is not easily extendible to the
discrete scenario.
The most related algorithm to this work is the recent Discrete Chebyshev Classifier (DCC) algo-
rithm [2]. The DCC is based on the minimization of the worst case misclassification rate over the
class of probability distributions with the given marginals of the form (Xi, Xj , Y ). Similar to our
framework, the DCC method achieves the misclassification rate no larger than twice the misclassi-
fication rate of the optimum classifier. However, computation of the DCC classifier requires solving
a non-separable non-smooth optimization problem which is computationally demanding, while the
proposed algorithm results in a least squares optimization problem with a closed form solution.
Furthermore, in contrast to [2] which only considers deterministic decision rules, in this work we
2
consider the class of randomized decision rules. Finally, it is worth noting that the algorithm in [2]
requires tree structure to be tight, while our proposed algorithm works on non-tree structures as long
as the separability condition is satisfied.
2 Problem Formulation
Consider the binary classification problem with d discrete featuresX1, X2, . . . , Xd ∈ X and a target
variable Y ∈ Y , {0, 1}. Without loss of generality, let us assume that X , {1, 2, . . . ,m} and the
data points (X, Y ) are coming from an underlying probability distribution P̄X,Y (x, y). If the joint
probability distribution P̄(x, y) is known, the optimal classifier is given by the maximum a posteriori
probability (MAP) estimator, i.e., ŷMAP(x) , argmaxy∈{0,1} P̄(Y = y | X = x). However, the
joint probability distribution P̄(x, y) is often not known in practice. Therefore, in order to utilize
the MAP rule, one should first estimate P̄(x, y) using the training data instances. Unfortunately,
estimating the joint probability distribution requires estimating the value of P̄(X = x, Y = y) for
all (x, y) ∈ X d × Y which is intractable for large values of d. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, our
approach is to first estimate some low order marginals of the joint probability distribution P̄(·); and
then utilize the minimax criterion for classification.
Let C be the class of probability distributions satisfying the estimated marginals. For example, when
only pairwise marginals of the ground-truth distribution P̄ is estimated, the set C is the class of
distributions satisfying the given pairwise marginals, i.e.,
Cpairwise ,
{
PX,Y (·, ·)
∣∣ PXi,Xj (xi, xj) = P̄Xi,Xj (xi, xj), PXi,Y (xi, y) = P̄Xi,Y (xi, y),
∀xi, xj ∈ X , ∀y ∈ Y, ∀i, j
}
.
(1)
In general, C could be any class of probability distributions satisfying a set of estimated low order
marginals.
Let us also define δ to be a randomized classification rule with
δ(x) =
{
0 with probability qxδ
1 with probability 1− qxδ ,
for some qxδ ∈ [0, 1], ∀x ∈ X d. Given a randomized decision rule δ and a joint probability distribu-
tion PX,Y (x, y), we can extend P(·) to include our randomized decision rule. Then the misclassifi-
cation rate of the decision rule δ, under the probability distribution P(·), is given by P(δ(X) 6= Y ).
Hence, under minimax criterion, we are looking for a decision rule δ∗ which minimizes the worst
case misclassification rate. In other words, the robust decision rule is given by
δ∗ ∈ argmin
δ∈D
max
P∈C
P (δ(X) 6= Y ) , (2)
whereD is the set of all randomized decision rules. Notice that the optimal decision rule δ∗ may not
be unique in general.
3 Worst Case Error Minimization
In this section, we propose a surrogate objective for (2) which leads to a decision rule with misclas-
sification rate no larger than twice of the optimal decision rule δ∗. Later we show that the proposed
surrogate objective is connected to the minimum HGR principle [1].
Let us start by rewriting (2) as an optimization problem over real valued variables. Notice that each
probability distribution PX,Y (·, ·) can be represented by a probability vector p = [px,y | (x, y) ∈
X d × Y] ∈ R2md with px,y = P(X = x, Y = y) and
∑
x,y px,y = 1. Similarly, every randomized
rule δ can be represented by a vector qδ = [qxδ | x ∈ X d] ∈ Rm
d
. Adopting these notations, the
set C can be rewritten in terms of the probability vector p as
C ,
{
p
∣∣ Ap = b, 1Tp = 1, p ≥ 0} ,
3
where the system of linear equations Ap = b represents all the low order marginal constraints in
B; and the notation 1 denotes the vector of all ones. Therefore, problem (2) can be reformulated as
q∗δ ∈ argmin
0≤qδ≤1
max
p∈C
∑
x
(qxδ px,1 + (1− qxδ )px,0) , (3)
where px,0 and px,1 denote the elements of the vector p corresponding to the probability values
P(X = x, Y = 0) and P(X = x, Y = 1), respectively. The simple application of the minimax
theorem [9] implies that the saddle point of the above optimization problem exists and moreover,
the optimal decision rule is a MAP rule for a certain probability distribution P∗ ∈ C. In other words,
there exists a pair (δ∗,P∗) for which
P(δ∗(X) 6= Y ) ≤ P∗(δ∗(X) 6= Y ), ∀P ∈ C and P∗(δ(X) 6= Y ) ≥ P∗(δ∗(X) 6= Y ), ∀δ ∈ D.
Although the above observation characterizes the optimal decision rule to some extent, it does not
provide a computationally efficient approach for finding the optimal decision rule. Notice that it
is NP-hard to verify the existence of a probability distribution satisfying a given set of low order
marginals [10]. Based on this observation and the result in [11], we conjecture that in general,
solving (2) is NP-hard in the number variables and the alphabet size even when the set C is non-
empty. Hence, here we focus on developing a framework to find an approximate solution of (2).
Let us continue by utilizing the minimax theorem [9] and obtain the worst case probability distribu-
tion in (3) by p∗ ∈ argmaxp∈C min0≤qδ≤1
∑
x (q
x
δpx,1 + (1− qxδ )px,0) , or equivalently,
p∗ ∈ argmax
p∈C
∑
x
min {px,0 , px,1} . (4)
Despite convexity of the above problem, there are two sources of hardness which make the problem
intractable for moderate and large values of d. Firstly, the objective function is non-smooth. Sec-
ondly, the number of optimization variables is 2md and grows exponentially with the alphabet size.
To deal with the first issue, notice that the function inside the summation is the max-min fairness ob-
jective between the two quantities px,1 and px,0. Replacing this objective with the harmonic average
leads to the following smooth convex optimization problem:
p̃ ∈ argmax
p∈C
∑
x
px,1px,0
px,1 + px,0
. (5)
It is worth noting that the harmonic mean of the two quantities is intuitively a reasonable surrogate
for the original objective function since
px,1px,0
px,1 + px,0
≤ min {px,0 , px,1} ≤
2px,1px,0
px,1 + px,0
. (6)
Although this inequality suggests that the objective functions in (5) and (4) are close to each other,
it is not clear whether the distribution p̃ leads to any classification rule having low misclassification
rate for all distributions in C. In order to obtain a classification rule from p̃, the first naive approach
is to use MAP decision rule based on p̃. However, the following result shows that this decision rule
does not achieve the factor two misclassification rate obtained in [2].
Theorem 1 Let us define δ̃map(x) , argmaxy∈Y p̃x,y with the worst case error probability
ẽmap , maxP∈C P
(
δ̃map(X) 6= Y
)
. Then, e∗ ≤ ẽmap ≤ 4e∗, where e∗ is the worst case
misclassification rate of the optimal decision rule δ∗, that is, e∗ , maxP∈C P (δ∗(X) 6= Y ) .
Proof The proof is similar to the proof of next theorem and hence omitted here.
Next we show that, surprisingly, one can obtain a randomized decision rule based on the solution of
(5) which has a misclassification rate no larger than twice of the optimal decision rule δ∗.
Given p̃ as the optimal solution of (5), define the random decision rule δ̃ as
δ̃(x) =
 0 with probability
p̃ 2x,0
p̃ 2x,0+p̃
2
x,1
1 with probability
p̃ 2x,1
p̃ 2x,0+p̃
2
x,1
(7)
4
Let ẽ be the worst case classification error of the decision rule δ̃, i.e.,
ẽ , max
P∈C
P
(
δ̃(X) 6= Y
)
.
Clearly, e∗ ≤ ẽ according to the definition of the optimal decision rule e∗. The following theorem
shows that ẽ is also upper-bounded by twice of the optimal misclassification rate e∗.
Theorem 2 Define
θ , max
p∈C
∑
x
px,1px,0
px,1 + px,0
(8)
Then, θ ≤ ẽ ≤ 2θ ≤ 2e∗. In other words, the worst case misclassification rate of the decision rule
δ̃ is at most twice the optimal decision rule δ∗.
Proof The proof is relegated to the supplementary materials.
So far, we have resolved the non-smoothness issue in solving (4) by using a surrogate objective
function. In the next section, we resolve the second issue by establishing the connection between
problem (5) and the minimum HGR correlation principle [1]. Then, we use the existing result in [1]
to develop a computationally efficient approach for calculating the decision rule δ̃(·) for Cpairwise.
4 Connection to Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi Correlation
A commonplace approach to infer models from data is to employ the maximum entropy principle [7].
This principle states that, given a set of constraints on the ground-truth distribution, the distribution
with the maximum (Shannon) entropy under those constraints is a proper representer of the class.
To extend this rule to the classification problem, the authors in [8] suggest to pick the distribution
maximizing the target entropy conditioned to features, or equivalently minimizing mutual informa-
tion between target and features. Unfortunately, this approach does not lead to a computationally
efficient approach for model fitting and there is no guarantee on the misclassification rate of the re-
sulting classifier. Here we study an alternative approach of minimum HGR correlation principle [1].
This principle suggests to pick the distribution in C minimizing HGR correlation between the target
variable and features. The HGR correlation coefficient between the two random objects X and Y ,
which was first introduced by Hirschfeld and Gebelein [12, 13] and then studied by Rényi [14], is
defined as ρ(X, Y ) , supf,g E [f(X)g(Y )] , where the maximization is taken over the class of all
measurable functions f(·) and g(·) with E[f(X)] = E[g(Y )] = 0 and E[f2(X)] = E[g2(Y )] = 1.
The HGR correlation coefficient has many desirable properties. For example, it is normalized to be
between 0 and 1. Furthermore, this coefficient is zero if and only if the two random variables are
independent; and it is one if there is a strict dependence between X and Y . For other properties of
the HGR correlation coefficient see [14, 15] and the references therein.
Lemma 1 Assume the random variable Y is binary and define q , P(Y = 0). Then,
ρ(X, Y ) =
√
1− 1
q(1− q)
∑
x
[
PX,Y (x, 0)PX,Y (x, 1)
PX,Y (x, 0) + PX,Y (x, 1)
]
,
Proof The proof is relegated to the supplementary material.
This lemma leads to the following observation.
Observation: Assume the marginal distribution P(Y = 0) and P(Y = 1) is fixed for any
distribution P ∈ C. Then, the distribution in C with the minimum HGR correlation between X and
Y is the distribution P̃ obtained by solving (5). In other words, ρ(X, Y ; P̃) ≤ ρ(X, Y ;P), ∀ P ∈ C,
where ρ(X, Y ;P) denotes the HGR correlation coefficient under the probability distribution P.
Based on the above observation, from now on, we call the classifier δ̃(·) in (7) as the “Rényi clas-
sifier”. In the next section, we use the result of the recent work [1] to compute the Rényi classifier
δ̃(·) for a special class of marginals C = Cpairwise.
5
5 Computing Rényi Classifier Based on Pairwise Marginals
In many practical problems, the number of features d is large and therefore, it is only computation-
ally tractable to estimate marginals of order at most two. Hence, hereafter, we restrict ourselves
to the case where only the first and second order marginals of the distribution P̄ is estimated, i.e.,
C = Cpairwise. In this scenario, in order to predict the output of the Rényi classifier for a given data
point x, one needs to find the value of p̃x,0 and p̃x,1. Next, we state a result from [1] which sheds
light on the computation of p̃x,0 and p̃x,1. To state the theorem, we need the following definitions:
Let the matrix Q ∈ Rdm×dm and the vector d ∈ Rdm×1 be defined through their entries as
Qmi+k,mj+` = P̄(Xi+1 = k,Xj+1 = `), dmi+k = P̄(Xi+1 = k, Y = 1)− P̄(Xi+1 = k, Y = 0),
for every i, j = 0, . . . , d − 1 and k, ` = 1, . . . ,m. Also define the function h(z) : Rmd×1 7→ R as
h(z) ,
∑d
i=1 max{zmi−m+1, zmi−m+2, . . . , zmi}. Then, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3 (Rephrased from [1]) Assume Cpairwise 6= ∅. Let
γ , min
z∈Rmd×1
zTQz− dT z + 1
4
. (9)
Then,
√
1− γq(1−q) ≤ minP∈Cpairwise ρ(X, Y ;P), where the inequality holds with equality if and
only if there exists a solution z∗ to (9) such that h(z∗) ≤ 12 and h(−z
∗) ≤ 12 ; or equivalently, if and
only if the following separability condition is satisfied for some P ∈ Cpairwise.
EP[Y |X = x] =
d∑
i=1
ζi(xi), ∀x ∈ X d, (10)
for some functions ζ1, . . . , ζd. Moreover, if the separability condition holds with equality, then
P̃(Y = y
∣∣X = (x1, . . . , xd)) = 1
2
− (−1)y
d∑
i=1
z∗(i−1)m+xi . (11)
Combining the above theorem with the equality
P̃2(Y = 0,X = x)
P̃2(Y = 0,X = x) + P̃2(Y = 1,X = x)
=
P̃2(Y = 0 | X = x)
P̃2(Y = 0 | X = x) + P̃2(Y = 1 | X = x)
implies that the decision rule δ̃ and δ̃map can be computed in a computationally efficient manner
under the separability condition. Notice that when the separability condition is not satisfied, the
approach proposed in this section would provide a classification rule whose error rate is still bounded
by 2γ. However, this error rate does no longer provide a 2-factor approximation gap. It is also worth
mentioning that the separability condition is a property of the class of distribution Cpairwise and is
independent of the classifier at hand. Moreover, this condition is satisfied with a positive measure
over the simplex of the all probability distributions, as discussed in [1]. Two remarks are in order:
Inexact knowledge of marginal distribution: The optimization problem (9) is equivalent to solv-
ing the stochastic optimization problem
z∗ = argmin
z
E
[(
WT z− C
)2]
,
where W ∈ {0, 1}md×1 is a random vector with Wm(i−1)+k = 1 if Xi = k in the and
Wm(i−1)+k = 0, otherwise. Also define the random variable C ∈ {− 12 ,
1
2} with C =
1
2 if the
random variable Y = 1 and C = − 12 , otherwise. Here the expectation could be calculated with re-
spect to any distribution in C. Hence, in practice, the above optimization problem can be estimated
using Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method [16, 17] through the optimization problem
ẑ = argmin
z
1
n
n∑
i=1
(
(wi)T z− ci
)2
,
6
where (wi, ci) corresponds to the i-th training data point (xi, yi). Clearly, this is a least square
problem with a closed form solution. Notice that in order to bound the SAA error and avoid overfit-
ting, one could restrict the search space for ẑ [18]. This could also be done using regularizers such
as ridge regression by solving
ẑ ridge = argmin
z

n

i=1
(
(wi)T z− ci
)2
+ λridge‖z‖22.
Beyond pairwise marginals: When d is small, one might be interested in estimating higher order
marginals for predicting Y . In this scenario, a simple modification for the algorithm is to define
the new set of feature random variables
{
X̃ij = (Xi, Xj) | i 6= j
}
; and apply the algorithm to the
new set of feature variables. It is not hard to see that this approach utilizes the marginal information
P(Xi, Xj , Xk, X`) and P(Xi, Xj , Y ).
6 Robust Rényi Feature Selection
The task of feature selection for classification purposes is to preselect a subset of features for use in
model fitting in prediction. Shannon mutual information, which is a measure of dependence between
two random variables, is used in many recent works as an objective for feature selection [19, 20].
In these works, the idea is to select a small subset of features with maximum dependence with the
target variable Y . In other words, the task is to find a subset of variables S ⊆ {1, . . . , d} with
|S| ≤ k based on the following optimization problem
SMI , argmax
S⊆{1,...,d}
I(XS ;Y ), (12)
where XS , (Xi)i∈S and I (XS ;Y ) denotes the mutual information between the random variable
XS and Y . Almost all of the existing approaches for solving (12) are based on heuristic approaches
and of greedy nature which aim to find a sub-optimal solution of (12). Here, we suggest to replace
mutual information with the maximal correlation. Furthermore, since estimating the joint distribu-
tion of X and Y is computationally and statistically impossible for large number of features d, we
suggest to estimate some low order marginals of the groundtruth distribution P̄(X, Y ) and then solve
the following robust Rényi feature selection problem:
SRFS , argmax
S⊆{1,...,d}
min
P∈C
ρ(XS , Y ;P). (13)
When only pairwise marginals are estimated from the training data, i.e., C = Cpairwise, maximizing
the lower-bound
√
1− γq(1−q) instead of (13) leads to the following optimization problem
Ŝ RFS , argmax
|S|≤k
√
1− 1
q(1− q)
min
z∈ZS
zTQz− dT z + 1

,
or equivalently,
Ŝ RFS , argmin
|S|≤k
min
z∈ZS
zTQz− dT z,
where ZS ,
{
z ∈ Rmd
∣∣ ∑m
k=1 |zmi−m+k| = 0, ∀i /∈ S
}
. This problem is of combinatorial na-
ture. Howevre, using the standard group Lasso regularizer leads to the feature selection procedure
in Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 Robust Rényi Feature Selection
Choose a regularization parameter λ > 0 and define h(z) ,
∑d
i=1 max{zmi−m+1, . . . , zmi}.
Let ẑRFS ∈ argminz zTQz− dT z + λh(|z|).
Set S = {i |
∑m
k=1 |zRFSmi−m+k| > 0}.
Notice that, when the pairwise marginals are estimated from a set of training data points, the above
feature selection procedure is equivalent to applying the group Lasso regularizer to the standard
linear regression problem over the domain of indicator variables. Our framework provides a justifi-
cation for this approach based on the robust maximal correlation feature selection problem (13).
7
Remark 1 Another natural approach to define the feature selection procedure is to select a subset of
features S by minimizing the worst case classification error, i.e., solving the following optimization
problem
min
|S|≤k
min
δ∈DS
max
P∈C
P(δ(X) 6= Y ), (14)
where DS is the set of randomized decision rules which only uses the feature variables in
S. Define F(S) , minδ∈DS maxP∈C P(δ(X) 6= Y ). It can be shown that F(S) ≤
min|S|≤k minz∈ZS z
TQz − dT z + 14 . Therefore, another justification for Algorithm 1 is to
minimize an upper-bound of F(S) instead of itself.
Remark 2 Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm [21] can be used for
solving the optimization problem in Algorithm 1; see the supplementary material for more details.
7 Numerical Results
We evaluated the performance of the Rényi classifiers δ̃ and δ̃map on five different binary classifi-
cation datasets from the UCI machine learning data repository. The results are compared with five
different benchmarks used in [2]: Discrete Chebyshev Classifier [2], greedy DCC [2], Tree Aug-
mented Naive Bayes [3], Minimax Probabilistic Machine [4], and support vector machines (SVM).
In addition to the classifiers δ̃ and δ̃map which only use pairwise marginals, we also use higher
order marginals in δ̃2 and δ̃
map
2 . These classifiers are obtained by defining the new feature variables
{X̃ij = (Xi, Xj)} as discussed in section 5. Since in this scenario, the number of features is large,
we combine our Rényi classifier with the proposed group lasso feature selection. In other words,
we first select a subset of {X̃ij} and then find the maximum correlation classifier for the selected
features. The value of λridge and λ is determined through cross validation. The results are averaged
over 100 Monte Carlo runs each using 70% of the data for training and the rest for testing. The
results are summarized in the table below where each number shows the percentage of the error of
each method. The boldface numbers denote the best performance on each dataset.
As can be seen in this table, in four of the tested datasets, at least one of the proposed methods
outperforms the other benchmarks. Furthermore, it can be seen that the classifier δ̃map on average
performs better than δ̃. This fact could be due to the specific properties of the underlying probability
distribution in each dataset.

In order to evaluate the computational efficiency of the Rényi classifier, we compare its running
time with SVM over the synthetic data set with d = 10, 000 features and n = 200 data points.
Each feature Xi is generated by i.i.d. Bernoulli distribution with P(Xi = 1) = 0.7. The target
variable y is generated by y = sign(αTX + n) with n ∼ N (0, 1); and α ∈ Rd is generated with
30% nonzero elements each drawn from standard Gaussian distribution N (0, 1). The results are
averaged over 1000 Monte-Carlo runs of generating the data set and use 85% of the data points
for training and 15% for test. The Rényi classifier is obtained by gradient descent method with
regularizer λridge = 104. The numerical experiment shows 19.7% average misclassification rate for
SVM and 19.9% for Rényi classifier. However, the average training time of the Rényi classifier is
0.2 seconds while the training time of SVM (with Matlab SVM command) is 1.25 seconds.
