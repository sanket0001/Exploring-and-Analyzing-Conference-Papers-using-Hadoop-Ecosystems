Abstract
Perception is often described as a predictive process based on an optimal inference
with respect to a generative model. We study here the principled construction
of a generative model specifically crafted to probe motion perception. In that
context, we first provide an axiomatic, biologically-driven derivation of the model.
This model synthesizes random dynamic textures which are defined by stationary
Gaussian distributions obtained by the random aggregation of warped patterns.
Importantly, we show that this model can equivalently be described as a stochastic
partial differential equation. Using this characterization of motion in images, it
allows us to recast motion-energy models into a principled Bayesian inference
framework. Finally, we apply these textures in order to psychophysically probe
speed perception in humans. In this framework, while the likelihood is derived
from the generative model, the prior is estimated from the observed results and
accounts for the perceptual bias in a principled fashion.
1 Motivation
A normative explanation for the function of perception is to infer relevant hidden parameters from
the sensory input with respect to a generative model [7]. Equipped with some prior knowledge
about this representation, this corresponds to the Bayesian brain hypothesis, as has been perfectly
illustrated by the particular case of motion perception [19]. However, the Gaussian hypothesis
related to the parameterization of knowledge in these models —for instance in the formalization
of the prior and of the likelihood functions— does not always fit with psychophysical results [17].
As such, a major challenge is to refine the definition of generative models so that they conform to
the widest variety of results.
From this observation, the estimation problem inherent to perception is linked to the definition of an
adequate generative model. In particular, the simplest generative model to describe visual motion
is the luminance conservation equation. It states that luminance I(x, t) for (x, t) ∈ R2 × R is
approximately conserved along trajectories defined as integral lines of a vector field v(x, t) ∈ R2 ×
R. The corresponding generative model defines random fields as solutions to the stochastic partial
differential equation (sPDE),
〈v, ∇I〉+ ∂I
∂t
= W, (1)
1
where 〈·, ·〉 denotes the Euclidean scalar product in R2, ∇I is the spatial gradient of I . To match
the statistics of natural scenes or some category of textures, the driving term W is usually defined
as a colored noise corresponding to some average spatio-temporal coupling, and is parameterized
by a covariance matrix Σ, while the field is usually a constant vector v(x, t) = v0 accounting for a
full-field translation with constant speed.
Ultimately, the application of this generative model is essential for probing the visual system, for
instance to understand how observers might detect motion in a scene. Indeed, as shown by [9, 19],
the negative log-likelihood corresponding to the luminance conservation model (1) and deter-
mined by a hypothesized speed v0 is proportional to the value of the motion-energy model [1]
||〈v0, ∇(K ? I)〉 + ∂(K?I)∂t ||2, where K is the whitening filter corresponding to the inverse of Σ,
and ? is the convolution operator. Using some prior knowledge on the distribution of motions, for
instance a preference for slow speeds, this indeed leads to a Bayesian formalization of this inference
problem [18]. This has been successful in accounting for a large class of psychophysical observa-
tions [19]. As a consequence, such probabilistic frameworks allow one to connect different models
from computer vision to neuroscience with a unified, principled approach.
However the model defined in (1) is obviously quite simplistic with respect to the complexity of natu-
ral scenes. It is therefore useful here to relate this problem to solutions proposed by texture synthesis
methods in the computer vision community. Indeed, the literature on the subject of static textures
synthesis is abundant (see [16] and the references therein for applications in computer graphics).
Of particular interest for us is the work of Galerne et al. [6], which proposes a stationary Gaussian
model restricted to static textures. Realistic dynamic texture models are however less studied, and
the most prominent method is the non-parametric Gaussian auto-regressive (AR) framework of [3],
which has been refined in [20].
Contributions. Here, we seek to engender a better understanding of motion perception by im-
proving generative models for dynamic texture synthesis. From that perspective, we motivate the
generation of optimal stimulation within a stationary Gaussian dynamic texture model. We base our
model on a previously defined heuristic [10, 11] coined “Motion Clouds”. Our first contribution is
Figure 1: Parameterization of the class of Motion Clouds stimuli. The illustration relates the
parametric changes in MC with real world (top row) and observer (second row) movements.
(A) Orientation changes resulting in scene rotation are parameterized through θ as shown in
the bottom row where a horizontal a and obliquely oriented b MC are compared. (B) Zoom
movements, either from scene looming or observer movements in depth, are characterised by
scale changes reflected by a scale or frequency term z shown for a larger or closer object b
compared to more distant a. (C) Translational movements in the scene characterised by V
using the same formulation for static (a) slow (b) and fast moving MC, with the variability in
these speeds quantified by σV . (ξ and τ) in the third row are the spatial and temporal frequency
scale parameters. The development of this formulation is detailed in the text.

an axiomatic derivation of this model, seen as a shot noise aggregation of dynamically warped “tex-
tons”. This formulation is important to provide a clear understanding of the effects of the model’s
parameters manipulated during psychophysical experiments. Within our generative model, they
correspond to average translation speed and orientation of the “textons” and standard deviations
of random fluctuations around this average. Our second contribution (proved in the supplemen-
tary materials) is to demonstrate an explicit equivalence between this model and a class of linear
stochastic partial differential equations (sPDE). This shows that our model is a generalization of the
well-known luminance conservation equation. This sPDE formulation has two chief advantages: it
allows for a real-time synthesis using an AR recurrence and it allows one to recast the log-likelihood
of the model as a generalization of the classical motion energy model, which in turn is crucial to
allow for a Bayesian modeling of perceptual biases. Our last contribution is an illustrative appli-
cation of this model to the psychophysical study of motion perception in humans. This application
shows how the model allows us to define a likelihood, which enables a simple fitting procedure to
determine the prior driving the perceptual bias.
Notations. In the following, we will denote (x, t) ∈ R2 × R the space/time variable, and (ξ, τ) ∈
R2 × R the corresponding frequency variables. If f(x, t) is a function defined on R3, then f̂(ξ, τ)
denotes its Fourier transform. For ξ ∈ R2, we denote ξ = ||ξ||(cos(∠ξ), sin(∠ξ)) ∈ R2 its polar
coordinates. For a function g in R2, we denote ḡ(x) = g(−x). In the following, we denote with
a capital letter such as A a random variable, a we denote a a realization of A, we let PA(a) be the
corresponding distribution of A.
2 Axiomatic Construction of a Dynamic Texture Stimulation Model
Solving a model-based estimation problem and finding optimal dynamic textures for stimulating an
instance of such a model can be seen as equivalent mathematical problems. In the luminance con-
servation model (1), the generative model is parameterized by a spatio-temporal coupling function,
which is encoded in the covariance Σ of the driving noise and the motion flow v0. This coupling
(covariance) is essential as it quantifies the extent of the spatial integration area as well as the in-
tegration dynamics, an important issue in neuroscience when considering the implementation of
integration mechanisms from the local to the global scale. In particular, it is important to understand
modular sensitivity in the various lower visual areas with different spatio-temporal selectivities such
as Primary Visual Cortex (V1) or ascending the processing hierarchy, Middle Temple area (MT).
For instance, by varying the frequency bandwidth of such dynamic textures, distinct mechanisms
for perception and action have been identified [11]. However, such textures were based on a heuris-
tic [10], and our goal here is to develop a principled, axiomatic definition.
2.1 From Shot Noise to Motion Clouds
We propose a mathematically-sound derivation of a general parametric model of dynamic textures.
This model is defined by aggregation, through summation, of a basic spatial “texton” template g(x).
The summation reflects a transparency hypothesis, which has been adopted for instance in [6]. While
one could argue that this hypothesis is overly simplistic and does not model occlusions or edges, it
leads to a tractable framework of stationary Gaussian textures, which has proved useful to model
static micro-textures [6] and dynamic natural phenomena [20]. The simplicity of this framework
allows for a fine tuning of frequency-based (Fourier) parameterization, which is desirable for the
interpretation of psychophysical experiments.
We define a random field as
Iλ(x, t)
def.
=
1√
λ
∑
p∈N
g(ϕAp(x−Xp − Vpt)) (2)
where ϕa : R2 → R2 is a planar warping parameterized by a finite dimensional vector a. Intuitively,
this model corresponds to a dense mixing of stereotyped, static textons as in [6]. The originality is
two-fold. First, the components of this mixing are derived from the texton by visual transformations
ϕAp which may correspond to arbitrary transformations such as zooms or rotations, illustrated in
Figure 1. Second, we explicitly model the motion (position Xp and speed Vp) of each individual
texton. The parameters (Xp, Vp, Ap)p∈N are independent random vectors. They account for the
3
variability in the position of objects or observers and their speed, thus mimicking natural motions in
an ambient scene. The set of translations (Xp)p∈N is a 2-D Poisson point process of intensity λ > 0.
The following section instantiates this idea and proposes canonical choices for these variabilities.
The warping parameters (Ap)p are distributed according to a distribution PA. The speed parameters
(Vp)p are distributed according to a distribution PV on R2. The following result shows that the
model (2) converges to a stationary Gaussian field and gives the parameterization of the covariance.
Its proof follows from a specialization of [5, Theorem 3.1] to our setting.
Proposition 1. Iλ is stationary with bounded second order moments. Its covariance is
Σ(x, t, x′, t′) = γ(x− x′, t− t′) where γ satisfies
∀ (x, t) ∈ R3, γ(x, t) =
∫ ∫
R2
cg(ϕa(x− νt))PV (ν)PA(a)dνda (3)
where cg = g ? ḡ is the auto-correlation of g. When λ → +∞, it converges (in the sense of finite
dimensional distributions) toward a stationary Gaussian field I of zero mean and covariance Σ.
2.2 Definition of “Motion Clouds”
We detail this model here with warpings as rotations and scalings (see Figure 1). These account for
the characteristic orientations and sizes (or spatial scales) in a scene with respect to the observer
∀ a = (θ, z) ∈ [−π, π)× R∗+, ϕa(x)
def.
= zR−θ(x),
where Rθ is the planar rotation of angle θ. We now give some physical and biological motivation
underlying our particular choice for the distributions of the parameters. We assume that the distribu-
tions PZ and PΘ of spatial scales z and orientations θ, respectively (see Figure 1), are independent
and have densities, thus considering ∀ a = (θ, z) ∈ [−π, π) × R∗+, PA(a) = PZ(z)PΘ(θ). The
speed vector ν is assumed to be randomly fluctuating around a central speed v0, so that
∀ ν ∈ R2, PV (ν) = P||V−v0||(||ν − v0||). (4)
In order to obtain “optimal” responses to the stimulation (as advocated by [21]), it makes sense to
define the texton g to be equal to an oriented Gabor acting as an atom, based on the structure of
a standard receptive field of V1. Each would have a scale σ and a central frequency ξ0. Since the
orientation and scale of the texton is handled by the (θ, z) parameters, we can impose without loss of
generality the normalization ξ0 = (1, 0). In the special case where σ → 0, g is a grating of frequency
ξ0, and the image I is a dense mixture of drifting gratings, whose power-spectrum has a closed form
expression detailed in Proposition 2. Its proof can be found in the supplementary materials. We call
this Gaussian field a Motion Cloud (MC), and it is parameterized by the envelopes (PZ ,PΘ,PV ) and
has central frequency and speed (ξ0, v0). Note that it is possible to consider any arbitrary textons
g, which would give rise to more complicated parameterizations for the power spectrum ĝ, but we
decided here to stick to the simple case of gratings.
Proposition 2. When g(x) = ei〈x, ξ0〉, the image I defined in Proposition 1 is a stationary Gaussian
field of covariance having the power-spectrum
∀ (ξ, τ) ∈ R2 × R, γ̂(ξ, τ) = PZ (||ξ||)||ξ||2 PΘ (∠ξ)L(P||V−v0||)
(
−τ + 〈v0, ξ〉||ξ||
)
, (5)
where the linear transform L is such that ∀u ∈ R,L(f)(u) =
∫ π
−π f(−u/ cos(ϕ))dϕ.
Remark 1. Note that the envelope of γ̂ is shaped along a cone in the spatial and temporal domains.
This is an important and novel contribution when compared to a Gaussian formulation like a clas-
sical Gabor. In particular, the bandwidth is then constant around the speed plane or the orientation
line with respect to spatial frequency. Basing the generation of the textures on all possible transla-
tions, rotations and zooms, we thus provide a principled approach to show that bandwidth should be
proportional to spatial frequency to provide a better model of moving textures.
2.3 Biologically-inspired Parameter Distributions
We now give meaningful specialization for the probability distributions (PZ ,PΘ,P||V−v0||), which
are inspired by some known scaling properties of the visual transformations relevant to dynamic
scene perception.
4
First, small, centered, linear movements of the observer along the axis of view (orthogonal to the
plane of the scene) generate centered planar zooms of the image. From the linear modeling of the
observer’s displacement and the subsequent multiplicative nature of zoom, scaling should follow a
Weber-Fechner law stating that subjective sensation when quantified is proportional to the logarithm
of stimulus intensity. Thus, we choose the scaling z drawn from a log-normal distribution PZ ,
defined in (6). The bandwidth σZ quantifies the variance in the amplitude of zooms of individual
textons relative to the set characteristic scale z0. Similarly, the texture is perturbed by variation in the
global angle θ of the scene: for instance, the head of the observer may roll slightly around its normal
position. The von-Mises distribution – as a good approximation of the warped Gaussian distribution
around the unit circle – is an adapted choice for the distribution of θ with mean θ0 and bandwidth
σΘ, see (6). We may similarly consider that the position of the observer is variable in time. On first
order, movements perpendicular to the axis of view dominate, generating random perturbations to
the global translation v0 of the image at speed ν − v0 ∈ R2. These perturbations are for instance
described by a Gaussian random walk: take for instance tremors, which are constantly jittering,
small (6 1 deg) movements of the eye. This justifies the choice of a radial distribution (4) for
PV . This radial distribution P||V−v0|| is thus selected as a bell-shaped function of width σV , and we
choose here a Gaussian function for simplicity, see (6). Note that, as detailed in the supplementary
a slightly different bell-function (with a more complicated expression) should be used to obtain an
exact equivalence with the sPDE discretization mentioned in Section 4.
The distributions of the parameters are thus chosen as
PZ(z) ∝

Clouds (right).
Plugging these expressions (6) into the definition (5) of the power spectrum of the motion cloud,
one obtains a parameterization which is very similar to the one originally introduced in [11]. The
following table gives the speed v0 and frequency (θ0, z0) central parameters in terms of amplitude
and orientation, each one being coupled with the relevant dispersion parameters. Figure 1 and 2
shows a graphical display of the influence of these parameters.

Remark 3. Note that the final envelope of γ̂ is in agreement with the formulation that is used in [10].
However, that previous derivation was based on a heuristic which intuitively emerged from a long
interaction between modelers and psychophysicists. Herein, we justified these different points from
first principles.
Remark 4. The MC model can equally be described as a stationary solution of a stochastic partial
differential equation (sPDE). This sPDE formulation is important since we aim to deal with dynamic
stimulation, which should be described by a causal equation which is local in time. This is crucial
for numerical simulations, since, this allows us to perform real-time synthesis of stimuli using an
5
auto-regressive time discretization. This is a significant departure from previous Fourier-based im-
plementation of dynamic stimulation [10, 11]. This is also important to simplify the application
of MC inside a bayesian model of psychophysical experiments (see Section 3)The derivation of an
equivalent sPDE model exploits a spectral formulation of MCs as Gaussian Random fields. The full
proof along with the synthesis algorithm can be found in the supplementary material.
3 Psychophysical Study: Speed Discrimination
To exploit the useful features of our MC model and provide a generalizable proof of concept based
on motion perception, we consider here the problem of judging the relative speed of moving dy-
namical textures and the impact of both average spatial frequency and average duration of temporal
correlations.
3.1 Methods
The task was to discriminate the speed v ∈ R of MC stimuli moving with a horizontal central
speed v = (v, 0). We assign as independent experimental variable the most represented spatial
frequency mZ , that we denote in the following z for easier reading. The other parameters are
set to the following values σV = 1t?z , θ0 =
π
2 , σΘ =
π
12 , and dZ = 1.0 c/
◦. Note
that σV is thus dependent of the value of z (that is computed from mZ and dZ , see Remark 2
and the supplementary ) to ensure that t? = 1σV z stays constant. This parameter t
? controls the
temporal frequency bandwidth, as illustrated on the middle of Figure 2. We used a two alternative
forced choice (2AFC) paradigm. In each trial a grey fixation screen with a small dark fixation spot
was followed by two stimulus intervals of 250 ms each, separated by a grey 250 ms inter-stimulus
interval. The first stimulus had parameters (v1, z1) and the second had parameters (v2, z2). At the
end of the trial, a grey screen appeared asking the participant to report which one of the two intervals
was perceived as moving faster by pressing one of two buttons, that is whether v1 > v2 or v2 > v1.
Given reference values (v?, z?), for each trial, (v1, z1) and (v2, z2) are selected so that{
vi = v
?, zi ∈ z? + ∆Z
vj ∈ v? + ∆V , zj = z? where
{
∆V = {−2,−1, 0, 1, 2},
∆Z = {−0.48,−0.21, 0, 0.32, 0.85},
where (i, j) = (1, 2) or (i, j) = (2, 1) (i.e. the ordering is randomized across trials), and where z
values are expressed in cycles per degree (c/◦) and v values in ◦/s. Ten repetitions of each of the 25
possible combinations of these parameters are made per block of 250 trials and at least four such
blocks were collected per condition tested. The outcome of these experiments are summarized by
psychometric curves ϕ̂v?,z? , where for all (v − v?, z − z?) ∈ ∆V ×∆Z , the value ϕ̂v?,z?(v, z) is
the empirical probability (each averaged over the typically 40 trials) that a stimulus generated with
parameters (v?, z) is moving faster than a stimulus with parameters (v, z?).
To assess the validity of our model, we tested four different scenarios by considering all possible
choices among z? = 1.28 c/◦, v? ∈ {5◦/s, 10◦/s}, and t? ∈ {0.1s, 0.2s}, which corresponds
to combinations of low/high speeds and a pair of temporal frequency parameters. Stimuli were gen-
erated on a Mac running OS 10.6.8 and displayed on a 20” Viewsonic p227f monitor with resolution
1024 × 768 at 100 Hz. Routines were written using Matlab 7.10.0 and Psychtoolbox 3.0.9 con-
trolled the stimulus display. Observers sat 57 cm from the screen in a dark room. Three observers
with normal or corrected to normal vision took part in these experiments. They gave their informed
consent and the experiments received ethical approval from the Aix-Marseille Ethics Committee in
accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.
3.2 Bayesian modeling
To make full use of our MC paradigm in analyzing the obtained results, we follow the methodology
of the Bayesian observer used for instance in [13, 12, 8]. We assume the observer makes its deci-
sion using a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator v̂z(m) = argmin
v
[− log(PM |V,Z(m|v, z))−
log(PV |Z(v|z))] computed from some internal representation m ∈ R of the observed stimulus. For
simplicity, we assume that the observer estimates z from m without bias. To simplify the numerical
analysis, we assume that the likelihood is Gaussian, with a variance independent of v. Furthermore,
6
we assume that the prior is Laplacian as this gives a good description of the a priori statistics of
speeds in natural images [2]:
PM |V,Z(m|v, z) =
1√
2πσz
e
− |m−v|
2
2σ2z and PV |Z(v|z) ∝ eazv1[0,vmax](v). (7)
where vmax > 0 is a cutoff speed ensuring that PV |Z is a well defined density even if az > 0.
Both az and σz are unknown parameters of the model, and are obtained from the outcome of the
experiments by a fitting process we now explain.
3.3 Likelihood and Prior Estimation
Following for instance [13, 12, 8], the theoretical psychophysical curve obtained by a Bayesian
decision model is
ϕv?,z?(v, z)
def.
= E(v̂z?(Mv,z?) > v̂z(Mv?,z))
where Mv,z ∼ N (v, σ2z) is a Gaussian variable having the distribution PM |V,Z(·|v, z).
The following proposition shows that in our special case of Gaussian prior and Laplacian likelihood,
it can be computed in closed form. Its proof follows closely the derivation of [12, Appendix A], and
can be found in the supplementary materials.
Proposition 3. In the special case of the estimator (3.2) with a parameterization (7), one has
ϕv?,z?(v, z) = ψ
(
v − v? − az?σ2z? + azσ2z√
σ2z? + σ
2
z
)
(8)
where ψ(t) = 1√
2π
∫ t
−∞ e
−s2/2ds is a sigmoid function.
One can fit the experimental psychometric function to compute the perceptual bias term µz,z? ∈ R
and an uncertainty λz,z? such that ϕ̂v?,z?(v, z) ≈ ψ
(
v−v?−µz,z?
λz,z?
)
.
Remark 5. Note that in practice we perform a fit in a log-speed domain ie we consider ϕṽ?,z?(ṽ, z)
where ṽ = ln(1 + v/v0) with v0 = 0.3◦/s following [13].
By comparing the theoretical and experimental psychopysical curves (8) and (3.3), one thus obtains
the following expressions σ2z = λ
2
z,z? − 12λ2z?,z? and az = az?
σ2z?
σ2z
− µz,z?σ2z . The only remaining
unknown is az? , that can be set as any negative number based on previous work on low speed priors
or, alternatively estimated in future by performing a wiser fitting method.
3.4 Psychophysic Results
The main results are summarized in Figure 3 showing the parameters µz,z? in Figure 3(a) and the
parameters σz in Figure 3(b). Spatial frequency has a positive effect on perceived speed; speed is
systematically perceived as faster as spatial frequency is increased, moreover this shift cannot simply
be explained to be the result of an increase in the likelihood width (Figure 3(b)) at the tested spatial
frequency, as previously observed for contrast changes [13, 12]. Therefore the positive effect could
be explained by a negative effect in prior slopes az as the spatial frequency increases. However, we
do not have any explanation for the observed constant likelihood width as it is not consistent with
the speed width of the stimuli σV = 1t?z which is decreasing with spatial frequency.
3.5 Discussion
We exploited the principled and ecologically motivated parameterization of MC to ask about the ef-
fect of scene scaling on speed judgements. In the experimental task, MC stimuli, in which the spatial
scale content was systematically varied (via frequency manipulations) around a central frequency of
1.28 c/◦ were found to be perceived as slightly faster at higher frequencies slightly slower at lower
frequencies. The effects were most prominent at the faster speed tested, of 10 ◦/s relative to those at
5 ◦/s. The fitted psychometic functions were compared to those predicted by a Bayesian model in
which the likelihood or the observer’s sensory representation was characterised by a simple Gaus-
sian. Indeed, for this small data set intended as a proof of concept, the model was able to explain

show shifts in the point of subjective equality for the range of test z. Stimuli of lower frequency
with respect to the reference (intersection of dotted horizontal and vertical lines gives the refer-

as going relatively faster. This effect is observed under all conditions but is stronger at the
highest speed and for subject 1. (b) The estimated σz appear noisy but roughly constant as a

(faster speed) is consistent with a key role for the prior in the observed perceptual bias.
A larger data set, including more standard spatial frequencies and the use of more observers, is
needed to disambiguate the models predicted prior function.
4 Conclusions
We have proposed and detailed a generative model for the estimation of the motion of images based
on a formalization of small perturbations from the observer’s point of view during parameterized
rotations, zooms and translations. We connected these transformations to descriptions of ecolog-
ically motivated movements of both observers and the dynamic world. The fast synthesis of nat-
uralistic textures optimized to probe motion perception was then demonstrated, through fast GPU
implementations applying auto-regression techniques with much potential for future experimenta-
tion. This extends previous work from [10] by providing an axiomatic formulation. Finally, we
used the stimuli in a psychophysical task and showed that these textures allow one to further under-
stand the processes underlying speed estimation. By linking them directly to the standard Bayesian
formalism, we show that the sensory representations of the stimulus (the likelihoods) in such mod-
els can be described directly from the generative MC model. In our case we showed this through
the influence of spatial frequency on speed estimation. We have thus provided just one example
of how the optimized motion stimulus and accompanying theoretical work might serve to improve
our understanding of inference behind perception. The code associated to this work is available at
