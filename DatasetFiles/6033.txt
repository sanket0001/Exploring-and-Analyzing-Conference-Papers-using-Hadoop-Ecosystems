Abstract
We consider a sequential learning problem with Gaussian payoffs and side ob-
servations: after selecting an action i, the learner receives information about the
payoff of every action j in the form of Gaussian observations whose mean is the
same as the mean payoff, but the variance depends on the pair (i, j) (and may be
infinite). The setup allows a more refined information transfer from one action to
another than previous partial monitoring setups, including the recently introduced
graph-structured feedback case. For the first time in the literature, we provide
non-asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds on the regret of any algorithm,
which recover existing asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds and finite-
time minimax lower bounds available in the literature. We also provide algorithms
that achieve the problem-dependent lower bound (up to some universal constant
factor) or the minimax lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors).
1 Introduction
Online learning in stochastic environments is a sequential decision problem where in each time step
a learner chooses an action from a given finite set, observes some random feedback and receives
a random payoff. Several feedback models have been considered in the literature: The simplest is
the full information case where the learner observes the payoff of all possible actions at the end
of every round. A popular setup is the case of bandit feedback, where the learner only observes
its own payoff and receives no information about the payoff of other actions [1]. Recently, several
papers considered a more refined setup, called graph-structured feedback, that interpolates between
the full-information and the bandit case: here the feedback structure is described by a (possibly
directed) graph, and choosing an action reveals the payoff of all actions that are connected to the
selected one, including the chosen action itself. This problem, motivated for example by social
networks, has been studied extensively in both the adversarial [2, 3, 4, 5] and the stochastic cases
[6, 7]. However, most algorithms presented heavily depend on the self-observability assumption,
that is, that the payoff of the selected action can be observed. Removing this self-loop assumption
leads to the so-called partial monitoring case [5]. In the absolutely general partial monitoring setup
the learner receives some general feedback that depends on its choice (and the environment), with
some arbitrary (but known) dependence [8, 9]. While the partial monitoring setup covers all other
problems, its analysis has concentrated on the finite case where both the set of actions and the set
of feedback signals are finite [8, 9], which is in contrast to the standard full information and bandit
settings where the feedback is typically assumed to be real-valued. To our knowledge there are only
a few exceptions to this case: in [5], graph-structured feedback is considered without the self-loop
assumption, while continuous action spaces are considered in [10] and [11] with special feedback
structure (linear and censored observations, resp.).
In this paper we consider a generalization of the graph-structured feedback model that can also be
viewed as a general partial monitoring model with real-valued feedback. We assume that selecting
1
an action i the learner can observe a random variable Xij for each action j whose mean is the same
as the payoff of j, but its variance σ2ij depends on the pair (i, j). For simplicity, throughout the paper
we assume that all the payoffs and the Xij are Gaussian. While in the graph-structured feedback
case one either has observation on an action or not, but the observation always gives the same amount
of information, our model is more refined: Depending on the value of σ2ij , the information can be
of different quality. For example, if σ2ij = ∞, trying action i gives no information about action j.
In general, for any σ2ij < ∞, the value of the information depends on the time horizon T of the
problem: when σ2ij is large relative to T (and the payoff differences of the actions) essentially no
information is received, while a small variance results in useful observations.
After defining the problem formally in Section 2, we provide non-asymptotic problem-dependent
lower bounds in Section 3, which depend on the distribution of the observations through their mean
payoffs and variances. To our knowledge, these are the first such bounds presented for any stochas-
tic partial monitoring problem beyond the full-information setting: previous work either presented
asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds (e.g., [12, 7]), or finite-time minimax bounds (e.g.,
[9, 3, 5]). Our bounds can recover all previous bounds up to some universal constant factors not de-
pending on the problem. In Section 4, we present two algorithms with finite-time performance
guarantees for the case of graph-structured feedback without the self-observability assumption.
While due to their complicated forms it is hard to compare our finite-time upper and lower bounds,
we show that our first algorithm achieves the asymptotic problem-dependent lower bound up to
problem-independent multiplicative factors. Regarding the minimax regret, the hardness (Θ̃(T 1/2)
or Θ̃(T 2/3) regret1) of partial monitoring problems is characterized by their global/local observabil-
ity property [9] or, in case of the graph-structured feedback model, by their strong/weak observabil-
ity property [5]. In the same section we present another algorithm that achieves the minimax regret
(up to logarithmic factors) under both strong and weak observability, and achieves an O(log3/2 T )
problem-dependent regret. Earlier results for the stochastic graph-structured feedback problems
[6, 7] provided only asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds and performance bounds that did
not match the asymptotic lower bounds or the minimax rate up to constant factors. A related combi-
natorial partial monitoring problem with linear feedback was considered in [10], where the presented
algorithm was shown to satisfy both an Õ(T 2/3) minimax bound and a logarithmic problem depen-
dent bound. However, the dependence on the problem structure in that paper is not optimal, and, in
particular, the paper does not achieve the O(
√
T ) minimax bound for easy problems. Finally, we
draw conclusions and consider some interesting future directions in Section 5. Proofs can be found
in the long version of this paper [13].
2 Problem Formulation
Formally, we consider an online learning problem with Gaussian payoffs and side observations:
Suppose a learner has to choose from K actions in every round. When choosing an action, the
learner receives a random payoff and also some side observations corresponding to other actions.
More precisely, each action i ∈ [K] = {1, . . . ,K} is associated with some parameter θi, and
the payoff Yt,i to action i in round t is normally distributed random variable with mean θi and
variance σ2ii, while the learner observes a K-dimensional Gaussian random vector Xt,i whose jth
coordinate is a normal random variable with mean θj and variance σ2ij (we assume 0 ≤ σij ≤ ∞)
and the coordinates of Xt,i are independent of each other. We assume the following: (i) the random
variables (Xt, Yt)t are independent for all t; (ii) the parameter vector θ is unknown to the learner but
the variance matrix Σ = (σ2ij)i,j∈[K] is known in advance; (iii) θ ∈ [0, D]K for some D > 0; (iv)
mini∈[K] σij ≤ σ <∞ for all j ∈ [K], that is, the expected payoff of each action can be observed.
The goal of the learner is to maximize its payoff or, in other words, minimize the expected regret
RT = T max

θi −

where it is the action selected by the learner in round t. Note that the problem encompasses several
common feedback models considered in online learning (modulo the Gaussian assumption), and
makes it possible to examine more delicate observation structures:
1Tilde denotes order up to logarithmic factors.
2
Full information: σij = σj <∞ for all i, j ∈ [K].
Bandit: σii <∞ and σij =∞ for all i 6= j ∈ [K].
Partial monitoring with feedback graphs [5]: Each action i ∈ [K] is associated with an observa-
tion set Si ⊂ [K] such that σij = σj <∞ if j ∈ Si and σij =∞ otherwise.
We will call the uniform variance version of these problems when all the finite σij are equal to some
σ ≥ 0. Some interesting features of the problem can be seen when considering the generalized full
information case , when all entries of Σ are finite. In this case, the greedy algorithm, which estimates
the payoff of each action by the average of the corresponding observed samples and selects the one
with the highest average, achieves at most a constant regret for any time horizon T .2 On the other
hand, the constant can be quite large: in particular, when the variance of some observations are
large relative to the gaps dj = maxi θi − θj , the situation is rather similar to a partial monitoring
setup for a smaller, finite time horizon. In this paper we are going to analyze this problem and
present algorithms and lower bounds that are able to “interpolate” between these cases and capture
the characteristics of the different regimes.
2.1 Notation
Define CNT = {c ∈ NK : ci ≥ 0 ,
∑
i∈[K] ci = T} and let N(T ) ∈ CNT denote the number of
plays over all actions taken by some algorithm in T rounds. Also let CRT = {c ∈ RK : ci ≥
0 ,
∑
i∈[K] ci = T}. We will consider environments with different expected payoff vectors θ ∈ Θ,
but the variance matrix Σ will be fixed. Therefore, an environment can be specified by θ; oftentimes,
we will explicitly denote the dependence of different quantities on θ: The probability and expectation
functionals under environment θ will be denoted by Pr (·; θ) and E [·; θ], respectively. Furthermore,
let ij(θ) be the jth best action (ties are broken arbitrarily, i.e., θi1 ≥ θi2 ≥ · · · ≥ θiK ) and define
di(θ) = θi1(θ) − θi for any i ∈ [K]. Then the expected regret under environment θ is RT (θ) =∑
i∈[K] E [Ni(T ); θ] di(θ). For any action i ∈ [K], let Si = {j ∈ [K] : σij <∞} denote the set of
actions whose parameter θj is observable by choosing action i. Throughout the paper, log denotes
the natural logarithm and ∆n denotes the n-dimensional simplex for any positive integer n.
3 Lower Bounds
The aim of this section is to derive generic, problem-dependent lower bounds to the regret, which
are also able to provide minimax lower bounds. The hardness in deriving such bounds is that for any
fixed θ and Σ, the dumb algorithm that always selects i1(θ) achieves zero regret (obviously, the re-
gret of this algorithm is linear for any θ′ with i1(θ) 6= i1(θ′)), so in general it is not possible to give a
lower bound for a single instance. When deriving asymptotic lower bounds, this is circumvented by
only considering consistent algorithms whose regret is sub-polynomial for any problem [12]. How-
ever, this asymptotic notion of consistency is not applicable to finite-horizon problems. Therefore,
following ideas of [14], for any problem we create a family of related problems (by perturbing the
mean payoffs) such that if the regret of an algorithm is “too small” in one of the problems than it
will be “large” in another one, while it still depends on the original problem parameters (note that
deriving minimax bounds usually only involves perturbing certain special “worst-case” problems).
As a warm-up, and to show the reader what form of a lower bound can be expected, first we present
an asymptotic lower bound for the uniform-variance version of the problem of partial monitoring
with feedback graphs. The result presented below is an easy consequence of [12], hence its proof
is omitted. An algorithm is said to be consistent if supθ∈ΘRT (θ) = o(T
γ) for every γ > 0. Now
assume for simplicity that there is a unique optimal action in environment θ, that is, θi1(θ) > θi for
all i 6= i1 and let
Cθ =
c ∈ [0,∞)K : ∑
i:j∈Si
ci ≥
2σ2
d2j (θ)
for all j 6= i1(θ) ,
∑
i:i1(θ)∈Si
ci ≥
2σ2
d2i2(θ)(θ)
 .
2To see this, notice that the error of identifying the optimal action decays exponentially with the number of
rounds.

Note that the right hand side of (1) is 0 for any generalized full information problem (recall that
the expected regret is bounded by a constant for such problems), but it is a finite positive number
for other problems. Similar bounds have been provided in [6, 7] for graph-structured feedback with
self-observability (under non-Gaussian assumptions on the payoffs). In the following we derive
finite time lower bounds that are also able to replicate this result.
3.1 A General Finite Time Lower Bound
First we derive a general lower bound. For any θ, θ′ ∈ Θ and q ∈ ∆|CNT |, define f(θ, q, θ′) as
f(θ, q, θ′) = inf
q′∈∆|C
N

∑
a∈CNT
q′(a) 〈a, d(θ′)〉
such that

q′(a)
≤
∑
i∈[K]
Ii(θ, θ′) ∑
a∈CNT
q(a)ai
 ,
where Ii(θ, θ′) is the KL-divergence between Xt,i(θ) and Xt,i(θ′), given by Ii(θ, θ′) =
KL(Xt,i(θ);Xt,i(θ
′)) =
∑K
j=1(θj − θ′j)2/2σ2ij . Clearly, f(θ, q, θ′) is a lower bound on RT (θ′)
for any algorithm for which the distribution of N(T ) is q. The intuition behind the allowed values
of q′ is that we want q′ to be as similar to q as the environments θ and θ′ look like for the algorithm
(through the feedback (Xt,it)t). Now define
g(θ, c) = inf
q∈∆|C
N
T
|
sup
θ′∈Θ
f(θ, q, θ′), such that
∑
a∈CNT
q(a)a = c ∈ CRT .
g(θ, c) is a lower bound of the worst-case regret of any algorithm with E [N(T ); θ] = c. Finally, for
any x > 0, define
b(θ, x) = inf
c∈Cθ,x
〈c, d(θ)〉 where Cθ,x = {c ∈ CRT ; g(θ, c) ≤ x}.
Here Cθ,B contains all the possible values of E [N(T ); θ] that can be achieved by some algorithm
whose lower bound g on the worst-case regret is smaller than x. These definitions give rise to the
following theorem:
Theorem 1. Given any B > 0, for any algorithm such that supθ′∈ΘRT (θ′) ≤ B, we have, for any
environment θ ∈ Θ, RT (θ) ≥ b(θ,B).
Remark 2. If B is picked as the minimax value of the problem given the observation structure Σ,
the theorem states that for any minimax optimal algorithm the expected regret for a certain θ is lower
bounded by b(θ,B).
3.2 A Relaxed Lower Bound
Now we introduce a relaxed but more interpretable version of the finite-time lower bound of Theo-
rem 1, which can be shown to match the asymptotic lower bound (1). The idea of deriving the lower
bound is the following: instead of ensuring that the algorithm performs well in the most adversarial
environment θ′, we consider a set of “bad” environments and make sure that the algorithm performs
well on them, where each “bad” environment θ′ is the most adversarial one by only perturbing one
coordinate θi of θ.
However, in order to get meaningful finite-time lower bounds, we need to perturb θ more carefully
than in the case of asymptotic lower bounds. The reason for this is that for any sub-optimal action
i, if θi is very close to θi1(θ), then E [Ni(T ); θ] is not necessarily small for a good algorithm for
θ. If it is small, one can increase θi to obtain an environment θ′ where i is the best action and the
algorithm performs bad; otherwise, when E [Ni(T ); θ] is large, we need to decrease θi to make the
4
algorithm perform badly in θ′. Moreover, when perturbing θi to be better than θi1(θ), we cannot
make θ′i−θi1(θ) arbitrarily small as in asymptotic lower-bound arguments, because when θ′i−θi1(θ)
is small, large E
[
Ni1(θ); θ
′], and not necessarily large E [Ni(T ); θ′], may also lead to low finite-time
regret in θ′. In the following we make this argument precise to obtain an interpretable lower bound.
3.2.1 Formulation
We start with defining a subset of CRT that contains the set of “reasonable” values for E [N(T ); θ].
For any θ ∈ Θ and B > 0, let
C ′θ,B =
c ∈ CRT :
K∑
j=1
cj
σ2ji
≥ mi(θ,B) for all i ∈ [K]

where mi, the minimum sample size required to distinguish between θi and its worst-case perturba-
tion, is defined as follows: For i 6= i1, if θi1 = D,3 then mi(θ,B) = 0. Otherwise let
mi,+(θ,B) = max
∈(di(θ),D−θi]
1
2 log
T (−di(θ))
8B ,
mi,−(θ,B) = max
∈(0,θi]
1
2 log
T (+di(θ))
8B ,
and let i,+ and i,− denote the value of  achieving the maximum in mi,+ and mi,−, respectively.
Then, define
mi(θ,B) =
{
mi,+(θ,B) if di(θ) ≥ 4B/T ;
min {mi,+(θ,B),mi,−(θ,B)} if di(θ) < 4B/T .
For i = i1, then mi1(θ,B) = 0 if θi2(θ) = 0, else the definitions for i 6= i1 change by replacing
di(θ) with di2(θ)(θ) (and switching the + and − indices):
mi1(θ),−(θ,B) = max
∈(di2(θ)(θ),θi1(θ)]
1
2 log
T (−di2(θ)(θ))
8B ,
mi1(θ),+(θ,B) = max
∈(0,D−θi1(θ)]
1
2 log
T (+di2(θ)(θ))
8B
where i1(θ),− and i1(θ),+ are the maximizers for  in the above expressions. Then, define
mi1(θ)(θ,B) =
{
mi1(θ),−(θ,B) if di2(θ)(θ) ≥ 4B/T ;
min
{
mi1(θ),+(θ,B),mi1(θ),−(θ,B)
}
if di2(θ)(θ) < 4B/T .
Note that i,+ and i,− can be expressed in closed form using the Lambert W : R → R function
satisfying W (x)eW (x) = x: for any i 6= i1(θ),
i,+ = min

(2)
and similar results hold for i = i1, as well.
Now we can give the main result of this section, a simplified version of Theorem 1:
Corollary 3. Given B > 0, for any algorithm such that supλ∈ΘRT (λ) ≤ B, we have, for any
environment θ ∈ Θ, RT (θ) ≥ b′(θ,B) = minc∈C′θ,B 〈c, d(θ)〉.
Next we compare this bound to existing lower bounds.
3.2.2 Comparison to the Asymptotic Lower Bound (1)
Now we will show that our finite time lower bound in Corollary 3 matches the asymptotic lower
bound in (1) up to some constants. Pick B = αT β for some α > 0 and 0 < β < 1. For sim-
plicity, we only consider θ which is “away from” the boundary of Θ (so that the minima in (2) are

to show that i,+ =

8B
for large enough T . Then, using the fact that log x − log log x ≤ W (x) ≤ log x for x ≥ e,
it follows that limT→∞mi(θ,B)/ log T = (1 − β)/d2i (θ), and similarly we can show that
limT→∞mi1(θ)(θ,B)/ log T = (1 − β)/d2i2(θ)(θ). Thus, C
′
θ,B →
(1−β) log T
2 Cθ, under the as-
sumptions of (1), as T →∞. This implies that Corollary 3 matches the asymptotic lower bound of
(1) up to a factor of (1− β)/2.
3.2.3 Comparison to Minimax Bounds
Now we will show that our θ-dependent finite-time lower bound reproduces the minimax regret
bounds of [2] and [5], except for the generalized full information case.
The minimax bounds depend on the following notion of observability: An action i is strongly ob-
servable if either i ∈ Si or [K] \ {i} ⊂ {j : i ∈ Sj}. i is weakly observable if it is not strongly
observable but there exists j such that i ∈ Sj (note that we already assumed the latter condition for
all i). LetW(Σ) be the set of all weakly observable actions. Σ is said to be strongly observable if
W(Σ) = ∅. Σ is weakly observable ifW(Σ) 6= ∅.
Next we will define two key qualities introduced by [2] and [5] that characterize the hardness of a
problem instance with feedback structure Σ: A set A ⊂ [K] is called an independent set if for any
i ∈ A, Si ∩ A ⊂ {i}. The independence number κ(Σ) is defined as the cardinality of the largest
independent set. For any pair of subsetsA,A′ ⊂ [K],A is said to be dominatingA′ if for any j ∈ A′
there exists i ∈ A such that j ∈ Si. The weak domination number ρ(Σ) is defined as the cardinality
of the smallest set that dominatesW(Σ).
Corollary 4. Assume that σij = ∞ for some i, j ∈ [K], that is, we are not in the generalized full
information case. Then,
(i) if Σ is strongly observable, with B = ασ

κ(Σ)T for some α > 0, we have

(ii) If Σ is weakly observable, with B = α(ρ(Σ)D)1/3(σT )2/3 log−2/3K for some α > 0, we
have supθ∈Θ b
′(θ,B) ≥ (ρ(Σ)D)

Remark 5. In Corollary 4, picking α = 1

73 log2/3K
.
4 Algorithms
In this section we present two algorithms and their finite-time analysis for the uniform variance
version of our problem (where σij is either σ or∞). The upper bound for the first algorithm matches
the asymptotic lower bound in (1) up to constants. The second algorithm achieves the minimax lower
bounds of Corollary 4 up to logarithmic factors, as well as O(log3/2 T ) problem-dependent regret.
In the problem-dependent upper bounds of both algorithms, we assume that the optimal action is
unique, that is, di2(θ)(θ) > 0.
4.1 An Asymptotically Optimal Algorithm
Let c(θ) = argminc∈Cθ 〈c, d(θ)〉; note that increasing ci1(θ)(θ) does not change the value of
〈c, d(θ)〉 (since di1(θ)(θ) = 0), so we take the minimum value of ci1(θ)(θ) in this definition. Let
ni(t) =
∑t−1
s=1 I {i ∈ Sis} be the number of observations for action i before round t and θ̂t,i be the
empirical estimate of θi based on the first ni(t) observations. Let Ni(t) =
∑t−1
s=1 I {is = i} be the
number of plays for action i before round t. Note that this definition of Ni(t) is different from that
in the previous sections since it excludes round t.

14: Set ne(t+ 1) = ne(t) + 1.

16: end for
Our first algorithm is presented in Algo-
rithm 1. The main idea, coming from
[15], is that by forcing exploration over
all actions, the solution c(θ) of the lin-
ear program can be well approximated
while paying a constant price. This solves
the main difficulty that, without getting
enough observations on each action, we
may not have good enough estimates for
d(θ) and c(θ). One advantage of our algo-
rithm compared to that of [15] is that we
use a nondecreasing, sublinear exploration
schedule β(n) (β : N → [0,∞)) instead
of a constant rate β(n) = βn. This re-
solves the problem that, to achieve asymp-
totically optimal performance, some pa-
rameter of the algorithm needs to be cho-
sen according to dmin(θ) as in [15]. The
expected regret of Algorithm 1 is upper
bounded as follows:
Theorem 6. For any θ ∈ Θ,  > 0, α > 2 and any non-decreasing β(n) that satisfies 0 ≤ β(n) ≤
n/2 and β(m+ n) ≤ β(m) + β(n) for m,n ∈ N,

Further specifying β(n) and using the continuity of c(θ) around θ, it immediately follows that Al-
gorithm 1 achieves asymptotically optimal performance:

Note that any β(n) = anb with a ∈ (0, 12 ], b ∈ (0, 1) satisfies the requirements in Theorem 6 and
Corollary 7. Also note that the algorithms presented in [6, 7] do not achieve this asymptotic bound.
4.2 A Minimax Optimal Algorithm
Next we present an algorithm achieving the minimax bounds. For any A,A′ ⊂ [K], let
c(A,A′) = argmaxc∈∆|A| mini∈A′
∑
j:i∈Sj cj (ties are broken arbitrarily) and m(A,A
′) =
mini∈A′
∑
j:i∈Sj cj(A,A
′). For any A ⊂ [K] and |A| ≥ 2, let AS = {i ∈ A : ∃j ∈ A, i ∈ Sj}
andAW = A−AS . Furthermore, let gr,i(δ) = σ
√
2 log(8K2r3/δ)
ni(r)
where ni(r) =
∑r−1
s=1 is,i and θ̂r,i
be the empirical estimate of θi based on first ni(r) observations (i.e., the average of the samples).
The algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2. It follows a successive elimination process: it explores all
possibly optimal actions (called “good actions” later) based on some confidence intervals until only
one action remains. While doing exploration, the algorithm first tries to explore the good actions
by only using good ones. However, due to weak observability, some good actions might have to be
explored by actions that have already been eliminated. To control this exploration-exploitation trade
off, we use a sublinear function γ to control the exploration of weakly observable actions.
In the following we present high-probability bounds on the performance of the algorithm, so, with a
slight abuse of notation, RT (θ) will denote the regret without expectation in the rest of this section.

Remark 10. Picking δ = 1/T gives an O(log3/2 T ) upper bound on the expected regret.
Remark 11. Note that Algortihm 2 is similar to the UCB-LP algorithm of [7], which admits a bet-
ter problem-dependent upper bound (although does not achieve it with optimal problem-dependent
constants), but it does not achieve the minimax bound even under strong observability.
5 Conclusions and Open Problems
We considered a novel partial-monitoring setup with Gaussian side observations, which generalizes
the recently introduced setting of graph-structured feedback, allowing finer quantification of the
observed information from one action to another. We provided non-asymptotic problem-dependent
lower bounds that imply existing asymptotic problem-dependent and non-asymptotic minimax lower
bounds (up to some constant factors) beyond the full information case. We also provided an algo-
rithm that achieves the asymptotic problem-dependent lower bound (up to some universal constants)
and another algorithm that achieves the minimax bounds under both weak and strong observability.
However, we think this is just the beginning. For example, we currently have no algorithm that
achieves both the problem dependent and the minimax lower bounds at the same time. Also, our
upper bounds only correspond to the graph-structured feedback case. It is of great interest to go
beyond the weak/strong observability in characterizing the hardness of the problem, and provide
algorithms that can adapt to any correspondence between the mean payoffs and the variances (the
hardness is that one needs to identify suboptimal actions with good information/cost trade-off).
