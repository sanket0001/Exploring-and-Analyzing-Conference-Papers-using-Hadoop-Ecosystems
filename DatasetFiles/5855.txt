Abstract
Multi-subject fMRI data is critical for evaluating the generality and validity
of findings across subjects, and its effective utilization helps improve analysis
sensitivity. We develop a shared response model for aggregating multi-subject
fMRI data that accounts for different functional topographies among anatomically
aligned datasets. Our model demonstrates improved sensitivity in identifying a
shared response for a variety of datasets and anatomical brain regions of interest.
Furthermore, by removing the identified shared response, it allows improved de-
tection of group differences. The ability to identify what is shared and what is not
shared opens the model to a wide range of multi-subject fMRI studies.
1 Introduction
Many modern fMRI studies of the human brain use data from multiple subjects. The use of multiple
subjects is critical for assessing the generality and validity of the findings across subjects. It is also
increasingly important since from one subject one can gather at most a few thousand noisy instances
of functional response patterns. To increase the power of multivariate statistical analysis, one there-
fore needs to aggregate response data across multiple subjects. However, the successful aggregation
of fMRI brain imaging data across subjects requires resolving the major problem that both anatomi-
cal structure and functional topography vary across subjects [1, 2, 3, 4]. Moreover, it is well known
that standard methods of anatomical alignment [1, 4, 5] do not adequately align functional topogra-
phy [4, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Hence anatomical alignment is often followed by spatial smoothing of the data
to blur functional topographies. Recently, functional spatial registration methods have appeared that
use cortical warping to maximize inter-subject correlation of time series [7] or inter-subject corre-
lation of functional connectivity [8, 9]. A more radical approach learns a latent multivariate feature
that models the shared component of each subject’s response [10, 11, 12].
Multivariate statistical analysis often begins by identifying a set of features that capture the informa-
tive aspects of the data. For example, in fMRI analysis one might select a subset of voxels within an
anatomical region of interest (ROI), or select a subset of principal components of the ROI, then use
these features for subsequent analysis. In a similar way, one can think of the fMRI data aggregation
problem as a two step process. First use training data to learn a mapping of each subject’s measured
data to a shared feature space in a way that captures the across-subject shared response. Then use
these learned mappings to project held out data for each subject into the shared feature space and
perform a statistical analysis.
To make this more precise, let {Xi ∈ Rv×d}mi=1 denote matrices of training data (v voxels in
the ROI, over d TRs) for m subjects. We propose using this data to learn subject specific bases
Wi ∈ Rv×k, where k is to be selected, and a shared matrix S ∈ Rk×d of feature responses such
that Xi = WiS +Ei where Ei is an error term corresponding to unmodeled aspects of the subject’s
response. One can think of the bases Wi as representing the individual functional topographies and
S as a latent feature that captures the component of the response shared across subjects. We don’t
claim that S is a sufficient statistic, but that is a useful analogy.

Figure 1: Comparison of training objective value and testing accuracy for problem (1) and (2) over various k
on raider dataset with 500 voxels of ventral temporal cortex (VT) in image stimulus classficiation experiment
(details in Sec.4). In all cases, error bars show ±1 standard error.
The contribution of the paper is twofold: First, we propose a probabilistic generative framework for
modeling and estimating the subject specific bases Wi and the shared response latent variable S. A
critical aspect of the model is that it directly estimates k  v shared features. This is in contrast to
methods where the number of features equals the number of voxels [10, 11]. Moreover, the Bayesian
nature of the approach provides a natural means of incorporating prior domain knowledge. Second,
we give a demonstration of the robustness and effectiveness of our data aggregation model using a
variety of fMRI datasets captured on different MRI machines, employing distinct analysis pathways,
and based on various brain ROIs.
2 Preliminaries
fMRI time-series data Xi ∈ Rv×d, i = 1 :m, is collected for m subjects as they are presented
with identical, time synchronized stimuli. Here d is the number of time samples in TRs (Time of
Repetition), and v is the number of voxels. Our objective is to model each subject’s response as
Xi = WiS+Ei where Wi ∈ Rv×k is a basis of topographies for subject i, k is a parameter selected
by the experimenter, S ∈ Rk×d is a corresponding time series of shared response coordinates, and
Ei is an error term, i = 1 :m. To ensure uniqueness of coordinates it is necessary that Wi has
linearly independent columns. We make the stronger assumption that each Wi has orthonormal
columns, WTi Wi = Ik.
Two approaches for estimating the bases Wi and the shared response S are illustrated below:
minWi,S
∑
i ‖Xi −WiS‖2F
s.t. WTi Wi = Ik,
(1)
minWi,S
∑
i ‖WTi Xi − S‖2F
s.t. WTi Wi = Ik,
(2)
where ‖ · ‖F denotes the Frobenius norm. For k ≤ v, (1) can be solved iteratively by first se-
lecting initial conditions for Wi, i = 1:m, and optimizing (1) with respect to S by setting S =
1/m
∑
iW
T
i Xi. With S fixed, (1) becomes m separate subproblems of the form min ‖Xi−WiS‖2F
with solution Wi = ŨiṼ Ti , where ŨiΣ̃iṼ
T
i is an SVD of XiS
T [13]. These two steps can be iter-
ated until a stopping criterion is satisfied. Similarly, for k ≤ v, (2) can also be solved iteratively.
However, for k < v, there is no known fast update of Wi given S. Hence this must be done using
local gradient decent on the Stiefel manifold [14]. Both approaches yield the same solution when
k = v, but are not equivalent in the more interesting situation k  v (Sup. Mat.). What is most
important, however, is that problem (2) with k < v, often learns an uninformative shared response
S. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 which plots of the value of the training objective and the test accuracy
for a stimulus classification experiment versus iteration count (image classification using the raider
fMRI dataset, see Sec.4). For problem (1), test accuracy increases with decreasing training error,
Whereas for problem (2), test accuracy decreases with decreasing training error (This can be ex-
plained analytically, see Sup. Mat.). We therefore base our approach on a generalization of problem
(1). We call the resulting S and {Wi}mi=1 a shared response model (SRM).
Before extending this simple model, we note a few important properties. First, a solution of (1)
is not unique. If S, {Wi}mi=1 is a solution, then so is QS, {WiQT }mi=1, for any k × k orthogonal
matrix Q. This is not a problem as long as we only learn one template and one set of subject bases.
Any new subjects or new data will be referenced to the original SRM. However, if we independently
learn two SRMs, the group shared responses S1, S2, may not be registered (use the same Q). We
register S1 to S2 by finding a k × k orthogonal matrix Q to minimize ‖S2 −QS1‖2F ; then use QS1
in place of S1 and WjQT in place of Wj for subjects in the first SRM.
Next, when projected onto the span of its basis, each subject’s training data Xi has coordinates
Si = W
T
i Xi and the learning phase ensures S = 1/m
∑m
i Si. The projection to k shared features
2
and the averaging across subjects in feature space both contribute to across-subject denoising during
the learning phase. By mapping S back into voxel space we obtain the voxel space manifestation
WiS of the denoised, shared component of each subject’s training data. The training data of subject
j can also be mapped through the shared response model to the functional topography and anatomy
of subject i by the mapping X̂i,j = WiWTj Xj .
New subjects are easily added to an existing SRM S, {Wi}mi=1. We refer to S as the training
template. To introduce a new subject j = m + 1 with training data Xj , form its orthonormal basis
by minimizing the mean squared modeling error minWj ,WTj Wj=Ik ‖Xj −WjS‖
2
F . We solve this
for the least norm solution. Note that S, and the existing W1:m do not change; we simply add a
new subject by using its training data for the same stimulus and the template S to determine its
basis of functional topographies. We can also add new data to an SRM. Let X ′i , i = 1:m, denote
new data collected under a distinct stimulus from the same subjects. This is added to the study by
forming S′i = W
T
i X
′
i , then averaging these projections to form the shared response for the new
data: S′ = 1/m
∑m
i=1W
T
i X
′
i . This assumes the learned subject specific topographies Wi generalize
to the new data. This usually requires a sufficiently rich stimulus in the learning phase.
3 Probabilistic Shared Response Model
We now extend our simple shared response model to a probabilistic setting. Let xit ∈ Rv denote
the observed pattern of voxel responses of the i-th subject at time t. For the moment, assume these
observations are centered over time. Let st ∈ Rk be a hyperparameter modeling the shared response
at time t = 1:d, and model the observation at time t for dataset i as the outcome of a random vector:
xit ∼ N (Wist, ρ2I), with WTi Wi = Ik, (3)
where, xit takes values in Rv , Wi ∈ Rv×k, i = 1:m, and ρ2 is a subject independent hyperpa-
rameter. The negative log-likelihood of this model is L =
∑
t
∑
i
v
2 log 2π +
v
2 log ρ
2 + ρ
−2
2 (xit −
Wist)
T (xit−Wist). Noting that xit is the t-th column ofXi, we see that minimizing Lwith respect
to Wi and S = [s1, . . . , sd], requires the solution of:
min
∑
t
∑
i(xit −Wist)T (xit −Wist) = min
∑
i ‖Xi −WiS‖2F .
Thus maximum likelihood estimation for this model matches (1).
In our fMRI datasets, and most multi-subject fMRI datasets available today, d  m. Since st is
time specific but shared across the m subjects, we see that there is palpable value in regularizing its
estimation. In contrast, subject specific variables such as Wi are shared across time, a dimension
in which data is relatively plentiful. Hence, a natural extension of (3) is to make st a shared latent
random vector st ∼ N (0,Σs) taking values in Rk. The observation for dataset i at time t then has
the conditional density p(xit|st) = N (Wist + µi, ρ2i I), where the subject specific mean µi allows
for a non-zero mean and we assume subject dependent isotropic noise covariance ρ2i I . This is an
extended multi-subject form of factor analysis, but in factor analysis one normally assumes Σs = I .
To form a joint model, let xTt = [x1t

xt = W st + µ+ , (4)
with xt ∼ N (µ,Σx) taking values in Rmv . For this joint model, we formulate SRM as:
st ∼ N (0,Σs),

where st takes values in Rk, xit takes values in Rv , and the hyperparameters Wi are matrices in
Rv×k, i = 1:m. The latent variable st, with covariance Σs, models a shared elicited response across
the subjects at time t. By applying the same orthogonal transform to each of theWi, we can assume,
without loss of generality, that Σs is diagonal. The SRM graphical model is displayed in Fig. 2.

3.1 Parameter Estimation for SRM
To estimate the parameters of the SRM model we apply a constrained EM algorithm to find max-
imum likelihood solutions. Let θ denote the vector of all parameters. In the E-step, given initial
value or estimated value θold from the previous M-step, we calculate the sufficient statistics by tak-
ing expectation with respect to p(st|xt, θold):
Es|x[st] = (WΣs)T (WΣsWT + Ψ)−1(xt − µ), (6)
Es|x[stsTt ] = Vars|x[st] + Es|x[st]Es|x[st]T
= Σs − ΣTsWT (WΣsWT + Ψ)−1WΣs + Es|x[st]Es|x[st]T . (7)
In the M-step, we update the parameter estimate to θnew by maximizing Q with respect to Wi, µi,
ρ2i , i = 1:m, and Σs. This is given by θ
new = arg maxθ Q(θ, θ
old), where
Q(θ, θold) = 1d
∑d
t=1
∫
p(st|xt, θold) log p(xt, st|θ)dst.
Due to the model structure, Q can be maximized with respect to each parameter separately. To
enforce the orthogonality of Wi, we bring a symmetric matrix Λi of Lagrange multipliers and add
the constraint term tr(Λi(WTi Wi − I)) to the objective function. Setting the derivatives of the
modified objective to zero, we obtain the following update equations:

The orthonormal constraint WTi Wi = Ik in SRM is similar to that of PCA. In general, there is no
reason to believe that key brain response patterns are orthogonal. So, the orthonormal bases found
via SRM are a computational tool to aid statistical analysis within an ROI. From a computational
viewpoint, orthogonality has the advantage of robustness and preserving temporal geometry.
3.2 Connections with related methods
For one subject, SRM is similar to a variant of pPCA [15] that imposes an orthogonality constraint
on the loading matrix. pPCA yields an orthogonal loading matrix. However, due to the increase in
model complexity to handle multiple datasets, SRM has an explicit constraint of orthogonal loading
matrices. Topographic Factor Analysis (TFA) [16] is a factor model using a topographic basis com-
posed of spherical Gaussians with different centers and widths. This choice of basis is constraining
but since each factor is an “blob” in the brain it has the advantage of providing a simple spatial in-
terpretation. Hyperalignment (HA) [10], learns a shared representational by rotating subjects’ time
series responses to maximize inter-subject time series correlation. The formulation in [10] is based
on problem (2) with k = v and Wi a v × v orthogonal matrix (Sup. Mat.). So this method does
not directly reduce the dimension of the feature space, nor does it directly extend to this case (see
Fig. 1). Although dimensionality reduction can be done posthoc using PCA, [10] shows that this
doesn’t lead to performance improvement. In contrast, we show in §4 that selecting k  v can
improve the performance of SRM beyond that attained by HA. The GICA, IVA algorithms [17] do
not assume time-synchronized stimulus and hence concatenate data along the time dimension (im-
plying spatial consistency) and learn spatial independent components. We use the assumption of a
time-synchronized stimulus for anchoring the shared response to overcome a spatial mismatch in
functional topographies. Finally, SRM can be regarded as a refinement of the concept of hyperalign-
ment [10] cast into a probabilistic framework. The HA approach has connections with regularized
CCA [18]. Additional details of these connections and connections with Canonical Correlation
Analysis (CCA) [19], ridge regression, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [20], regularized
Hyperalignment [18] are discussed in the supplementary material.
4 Experiments
We assess the performance and robustness of SRM using fMRI datasets (Table 1) collected using
different MRI machines, subjects, and preprocessing pipelines. The sherlock dataset was collected

ROIs vary in functional from visual, language, memory, to mental states. H stands for hemisphere.
while subjects watched an episode of the BBC TV series “Sherlock” (66 mins).The raider dataset
was collected while subjects viewed the movie “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (110 mins) and a series
of still images (7 categories, 8 runs). The forrest dataset was collected while subjects listened to
an auditory version of the film “Forrest Gump” (120 mins). The audiobook dataset was collected
while subjects listened to a narrated story (15 mins) with two possible interpretations. Half of the
subjects had a prior context favoring one interpretation, the other half had a prior context favoring
the other interpretation. Post scanning questionnaires showed no difference in comprehension but a
significant difference in interpretations between groups.
Experiment 1: SRM and spatial smoothing. We first use spatial smoothing to determine if we can
detect a shared response in PMC for the sherlock dataset. The subjects are randomly partitioned into
two equal sized groups, the data for each group is averaged, we calculate the Pearson correlation
over voxels between these averaged responses for each time, then average these correlations over
time. This is a measure of similarity of the sequence of brain maps in the two average responses. We
repeat this for five random subject divisions and average the results. If there is a shared response,
we expect a positive average correlation between the groups, but if functional topographies differ
significantly across subjects, this correlation may be small. If the result not distinct from zero, a
shared response is not detected. The computation yields the benchmark value 0.26 ± 0.006 shown
as the purple bar in the right plot in Fig. 3. This is support for a shared response in PMC, but we posit
that the subject’s functional topographies in PMC are misaligned. To test this, we use a Gaussian
filter, with width at half height of 3, 4, 5 and 6mm, to spatially smooth each subject’s fMRI data,
then recalculate the average Pearson correlation as described above. The results, shown as blue
bars in Fig. 3, indicate higher correlations with greater spatial smoothing. This indicates greater
average correlation of the responses at lower spatial frequencies, suggesting a fine scale mismatch
of functional topographies across subjects.
We now test the robustness of SRM using the unsmoothed data. The subjects are randomly parti-
tioned into two equal sized groups. The data in each group is divided in time into two halves, and the
same half in each group is used to learn a shared response model for the group. The independently
obtained group templates S1, S2, are then registered using a k × k orthogonal matrix Q (method
outlined in §2). For each group, the second half of the data is projected to feature space using the
subject-specific bases and averaged. Then the Pearson correlation over features is calculated be-
tween the group averaged shared responses, and averaged over time. This is repeated using the other
the halves of the subject’s data for training and the results are averaged. The average results over 5
random subject divisions are report as the green bars in Fig. 3. With k = 813 there is no reduction
of dimension and SRM achieves a correlation equivalent to 6mm spatial smoothing. This strong
average correlation between groups, suggests some form of shared response. As expected, if the
dimension of the feature space k is reduced, the correlation increases. A smaller value of k, forces

SRM to focus on shared features yielding the best data representation and gives greater noise re-
jection. Learning 50 features achieves a 33% higher average correlation in feature space than is
achieved by 6mm spatial smoothing in voxel space. A commensurate improvement occurs when
SRM is applied to the spatially smoothed data.
Experiment 2 : Time segment matching and image classification. We test if the shared response
estimated by SRM generalizes to new subjects and new data using versions of two experiments from
[10] (unlike in [10], here the held out subject is not included in learning phase). The first experiment
tests if an 18s time segment from a held-out subject’s new data can be located in the corresponding
new data of the training subjects. A shared response and subject specific bases are learned using half
of the data, and the held out subject’s basis is estimated using the shared response as a template. Then
a random 18s test segment from the unused half of the held out subject’s data is projected onto the
subject’s basis, and we locate the 18s segment in the averaged shared response of the other subject’s
new data that is maximally correlated with the test segment (see Fig. 4). The held out subject’s
test segment is correctly located (matched) if its correlation with the average shared response at
the same time point is the highest; segments overlapping with the test segment are excluded. We
record the average accuracy and standard error by two-fold cross-validation over the data halves
and leave-one-out over subjects. The results using three different fMRI datasets with distinct ROIs
are shown in the top plot of Fig. 5. The accuracy is compared using: anatomical alignment (MNI
[4], Talairach (TAL) [1]); standard PCA, and ICA feature selection (FastICA implementation [20]);
the Hyperalignment (HA) method [10]; and SRM. PCA and ICA are directly applied on joint data
matrixXT = [XT1 . . . X
T
m] for learningW and S, whereX ≈WS andWT = [WT1 . . .WTm]. SRM
demonstrates the best matching of the estimated shared temporal features of the methods tested. This
suggests that the learned shared response is more informative of the shared brain state trajectory at
an 18s time scale. Moreover, the experiment verifies generalization of the estimated shared features
to subjects not included in the training phase and new (but similar) data collected during the other
half of the movie stimulus. Since we expect accuracy to improve as the time segment is lengthened,

what is important is the relative accuracy of the compared methods. The method in (1) can be viewed
as non-probabilistic SRM. In this experiment, it performs worse than SRM but better than the other
compared methods. The effect of the number of features used in SRM is shown in Fig. 5, lower left.
This can be used to select k. A similar test on the number of features used in PCA and ICA indicates
lower performance than SRM (results not shown).
We now use the image viewing data and the movie data from the raider dataset to test the generaliz-
ability of a learned shared response to a held-out subject and new data under a very distinct stimulus.
The raider movie data is used to learn a shared response model, while excluding a held-out subject.
The held-out subject’s basis is estimated by matching its movie response data to the estimated shared
response. The effectiveness of the learned bases is then tested using the image viewing dataset [10].
After projecting the image data using the subject bases to feature space, an SVM classifier is trained
and the average classifier accuracy and standard error is recorded by leave-one-out across subject
testing. The results, lower right plot in Fig. 5, support the effectiveness of SRM in generalizing to
a new subject and a distinct new stimulus. Under SRM, the image stimuli can be slightly more ac-
curately identified using other subjects’ data for training than using a subject’s own data, indicating
that the learned shared response is informative of image category.
Experiment 3: Differentiating between groups. Now consider the audiobook dataset and the
DMN ROI. If subjects are given group labels according to the two prior contexts, a linear SVM
classifier trained on labeled voxel space data and tested on the voxel space data of held out subjects,
can distinguish the two groups at an above chance level. This is shown as the leftmost bar in the
bottom figure of Fig. 6.3. This is consistent with previous similar studies [28].
We test if SRM can distinguish the two subject groups with a higher rate of success. To do so we use
the procedure outlined in rows of Fig. 6.1. We first use the original data Xg11:m, X
g2
1:m of all subjects
(Fig. 6.1 (a)) to learn a k1-dimensional shared response Sall and subject bases W allgj,1:m. This shared
response is then mapped to voxel space using each subject’s learned topography (Fig. 6.1 (b)) and
subtracted from the subject’s data to form the residual responseXgji −W allgj,iSall for subject i in group
j (Fig. 6.1 (c)). Leaving out one subject from each group, we use two within-group applications of
SRM to find k2-dimensional within-group shared responses Sg1, Sg2, and subject basesW

for the residual response. These are mapped into voxel spaceW gji S
gj for each subject (Fig. 6.1 (d)).
The first application of SRM yields an estimate of the response shared by all subjects. This is used
to form the residual response. The subsequent within-group applications of SRM to the residual give
estimates of the within-group shared residual response. Both applications of SRM seek to remove
components of the original response that are uninformative of group membership. Finally, a linear
SVM classifier is trained using the voxel space group-labeled data, and tested on the voxel space
data of held out subjects. The results are shown as the red bars in Fig. 6.3. When using k1 = 10 and
k2 = 100, we observe significant improvement in distinguishing the groups.
One can visualize why this works using the cartoon in Fig. 6.2 showing the data for one subject
modeled as the sum of three components: the response shared by all subjects, the response shared
by subjects in the same group after the response shared by all subjects is removed, and a final residual
term called the individual response (Fig. 6.2(a)). We first identify the response shared by all subjects
(Fig. 6.2(b)); subtracting this from the subject response gives the residual (Fig. 6.2(c)). The second
within-group application of SRM removes the individual response (Fig. 6.2(d)). By tuning k1 in the
first application of SRM and tuning k2 in the second application of SRM, we estimate and remove
the uninformative components while keeping the informative component.
Classification using the estimated shared response (k1 ≤ 10) results in accuracy around chance
(Fig. 6.2(b)), indicating that it is uninformative for distinguishing the groups. The classification
accuracy using the residual response is statistically equivalent to using the original data (Fig. 6.2(c)),
indicating that only removing the response shared by all subjects is insufficient for improvement.
The classification accuracy that results by not removing the shared response (k1 = 0) and only
applying within-group SRM (Fig. 6.2(d)), is also statistically equivalent to using the original data.
This indicates that only removing the individual response is also insufficient for improvement. By
combining both applications of SRM we remove both the response shared by all subjects and the
individual responses, keeping only the responses shared within groups. For k1 =10, k2 = 100, this
leads to significant improvement in performance (Fig. 6.2(d) and Fig. 6.3).
We performed the same experiment using PCA and ICA (Fig. 6.3). In this case, after removing the
estimated shared response (k1 ≥ 1) group identification quickly drops to chance since the shared
response is informative of group difference (around 70% accuracy for distinguishing the groups
(Sup. Mat.)). A detailed comparison of all three methods on the different steps of the procedure is
given in the supplementary material.
5 Discussion and Conclusion
The vast majority of fMRI studies require aggregation of data across individuals. By identifying
shared responses between the brains of different individuals, our model enhances fMRI analyses that
use aggregated data to evaluate cognitive states. A key attribute of SRM is its built-in dimensionality
reduction leading to a reduced-dimension shared feature space. We have shown that by tuning this
dimensionality, the data-driven aggregation achieved by SRM demonstrates higher sensitivity in
distinguishing multivariate functional responses across cognitive states. This was shown across
a variety of datasets and anatomical brain regions of interest. This also opens the door for the
identification of shared and individual responses. The identification of shared responses after SRM
is of great interest, as it allows us to assess the degree to which functional topography is shared
across subjects. Furthermore, the SRM allows the detection of group specific responses. This was
demonstrated by removing an estimated shared response to increase sensitivity in detecting group
differences. We posit that this technique can be adapted to examine an array of situations where
group differences are the key experimental variable. The method can facilitate studies of how neural
representations are influenced by cognitive manipulations or by factors such as genetics, clinical
disorders, and development.
Successful decoding of a particular cognitive state (such as a stimulus category) in a given brain area
provides evidence that information relevant to that cognitive state is present in the neural activity of
that brain area. Conducting such analyses in locations spanning the brain, e.g., using a searchlight
approach, can facilitate the discovery of information pathways. In addition, comparison of decoding
accuracies between searchlights can suggest what kind of information is present and where it is
concentrated in the brain. SRM provides a more sensitive method for conducting such investigations.
This may also have direct application in designing better noninvasive brain-computer interfaces [29].
