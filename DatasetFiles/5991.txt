Abstract
Subspace clustering is an unsupervised learning problem that aims at grouping
data points into multiple “clusters” so that data points in a single cluster lie ap-
proximately on a low-dimensional linear subspace. It is originally motivated by
3D motion segmentation in computer vision, but has recently been generically
applied to a wide range of statistical machine learning problems, which often in-
volves sensitive datasets about human subjects. This raises a dire concern for
data privacy. In this work, we build on the framework of differential privacy
and present two provably private subspace clustering algorithms. We demonstrate
via both theory and experiments that one of the presented methods enjoys formal
privacy and utility guarantees; the other one asymptotically preserves differential
privacy while having good performance in practice. Along the course of the proof,
we also obtain two new provable guarantees for the agnostic subspace clustering
and the graph connectivity problem which might be of independent interests.
1 Introduction
Subspace clustering was originally proposed to solve very specific computer vision problems having
a union-of-subspace structure in the data, e.g., motion segmentation under an affine camera model
[11] or face clustering under Lambertian illumination models [15]. As it gains increasing attention
in the statistics and machine learning community, people start to use it as an agnostic learning tool in
social network [5], movie recommendation [33] and biological datasets [19]. The growing applica-
bility of subspace clustering in these new domains inevitably raises the concern of data privacy, as
many such applications involve dealing with sensitive information. For example, [19] applies sub-
space clustering to identify diseases from personalized medical data and [33] in fact uses subspace
clustering as a effective tool to conduct linkage attacks on individuals in movie rating datasets. Nev-
ertheless, privacy issues in subspace clustering have been less explored in the past literature, with
the only exception of a brief analysis and discussion in [29]. However, the algorithms and analysis
presented in [29] have several notable deficiencies. For example, data points are assumed to be inco-
herent and it only protects the differential privacy of any feature of a user rather than the entire user
profile in the database. The latter means it is possible for an attacker to infer with high confidence
whether a particular user is in the database, given sufficient side information.
It is perhaps reasonable why there is little work focusing on private subspace clustering, which
is by all means a challenging task. For example, a negative result in [29] shows that if utility is
measured in terms of exact clustering, then no private subspace clustering algorithm exists when
neighboring databases are allowed to differ on an entire user profile. In addition, state-of-the-art
subspace clustering methods like Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC, [11]) lack a complete analysis of
its clustering output, thanks to the notorious “graph connectivity” problem [21]. Finally, clustering
could have high global sensitivity even if only cluster centers are released, as depicted in Figure 1.
As a result, general private data releasing schemes like output perturbation [7, 8, 2] do not apply.
In this work, we present a systematic and principled treatment of differentially private subspace
clustering. To circumvent the negative result in [29], we use the perturbation of recovered low-
1
dimensional subspace from the ground truth as the utility measure. Our contributions are two-fold.
First, we analyze two efficient algorithms based on the sample-aggregate framework [22] and estab-
lished formal privacy and utility guarantees when data are generated from some stochastic model or
satisfy certain deterministic separation conditions. New results on (non-private) subspace clustering
are obtained along our analysis, including a fully agnostic subspace clustering on well-separated
datasets using stability arguments and exact clustering guarantee for thresholding-based subspace
clustering (TSC, [14]) in the noisy setting. In addition, we employ the exponential mechanism [18]
and propose a novel Gibbs sampler for sampling from this distribution, which involves a novel tweak
in sampling from a matrix Bingham distribution. The method works well in practice and we show it
is closely related to the well-known mixtures of probabilistic PCA model [27].
Related work Subspace clustering can be thought as a generalization of PCA and k-means clus-
tering. The former aims at finding a single low-dimensional subspace and the latter uses zero-
dimensional subspaces as cluster centers. There has been extensive research on private PCA
[2, 4, 10] and k-means [2, 22, 26]. Perhaps the most similar work to ours is [22, 4]. [22] applies the
sample-aggregate framework to k-means clustering and [4] employs the exponential mechanism to
recover private principal vectors. In this paper we give non-trivial generalization of both work to the
private subspace clustering setting.
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Notations
For a vector x ∈ Rd, its p-norm is defined as ‖x‖p = (
∑
i x
p
i )
1/p. If p is not explicitly specified
then the 2-norm is used. For a matrix A ∈ Rn×m, we use σ1(A) ≥ · · · ≥ σn(A) ≥ 0 to
denote its singular values (assuming without loss of generality that n ≤ m). We use ‖ · ‖ξ to
denote matrix norms, with ξ = 2 the matrix spectral norm and ξ = F the Frobenious norm. That
is, ‖A‖2 = σ1(A) and ‖A‖F =
√∑n
i=1 σi(A)
2. For a q-dimensional subspace S ⊆ Rd, we
associate with a basis U ∈ Rd×q , where the q columns in U are orthonormal and S = range(U).
We use Sdq to denote the set of all q-dimensional subspaces in Rd.
Given x ∈ Rd and S ⊆ Rd, the distance d(x,S) is defined as d(x,S) = infy∈S ‖x− y‖2. If S is
a subspace associated with a basis U , then we have d(x,S) = ‖x − PS(x)‖2 = ‖x −UU>x‖2,
where PS(·) denotes the projection operator onto subspace S . For two subspaces S,S ′ of dimension
q, the distance d(S,S ′) is defined as the Frobenious norm of the sin matrix of principal angles; i.e.,
d(S,S ′) = ‖ sin Θ(S,S ′)‖F = ‖UU> −U′U′>‖F , (1)
where U,U′ are orthonormal basis associated with S and S ′, respectively.
2.2 Subspace clustering
Given n data points x1, · · · ,xn ∈ Rd, the task of subspace clustering is to cluster the data points
into k clusters so that data points within a subspace lie approximately on a low-dimensional sub-
space. Without loss of generality, we assume ‖xi‖2 ≤ 1 for all i = 1, · · · , n. We also use
X = {x1, · · · ,xn} to denote the dataset and X ∈ Rd×n to denote the data matrix by stacking
all data points in columnwise order. Subspace clustering seeks to find k q-dimensional subspaces
Ĉ = {Ŝ1, · · · , Ŝk} so as to minimize the Wasserstein’s distance or distance squared defined as
d2W (Ĉ, C∗) = min
π:[k]→[k]
k∑
i=1
d2(Ŝi,S∗π(i)), (2)
where π are taken over all permutations on [k] and S∗ are the optimal/ground-truth subspaces. In a
model based approach, C∗ is fixed and data points {xi}ni=1 are generated either deterministically or
stochastically from one of the ground-truth subspaces in C∗ with noise corruption; for a completely
agnostic setting, C∗ is defined as the minimizer of the k-means subspace clustering objective:
C∗ := argminC={S1,··· ,Sk}⊆Sdq cost(C;X ) = argminC={S1,··· ,Sk}⊆Sdq
1
n
n∑
i=1
min
j
d2(xi,Sj). (3)
To simplify notations, we use ∆k(X ) = cost(C∗;X ) to denote cost of the optimal solution.

Algorithm 1 The sample-aggregate framework [22]
1: Input: X = {xi}ni=1 ⊆ Rd, number of subsets m, privacy parameters ε, δ; f , dM.
2: Initialize: s =
√
m, α = ε/(5
√
2 ln(2/δ)), β = ε/(4(D + ln(2/δ))).
3: Subsampling: Select m random subsets of size n/m of X independently and uniformly at
random without replacement. Repeat this step until no single data point appears in more than√
m of the sets. Mark the subsampled subsets XS1 , · · · ,XSm .
4: Separate queries: Compute B = {si}mi=1 ⊆ RD, where si = f(XSi).
5: Aggregation: Compute g(B) = si∗ where i∗ = argminmi=1ri(t0) with t0 = (m+s2 + 1). Here
ri(t0) denotes the distance dM(·, ·) between si and the t0-th nearest neighbor to si in B.
6: Noise calibration: Compute S(B) = 2 maxk(ρ(t0 + (k+ 1)s) · e−βk), where ρ(t) is the mean
of the top bs/βc values in {r1(t), · · · , rm(t)}.
7: Output: A(X ) = g(B) + S(B)α u, where u is a standard Gaussian random vector.
2.3 Differential privacy
Definition 2.1 (Differential privacy, [7, 8]). A randomized algorithmA is (ε, δ)-differentially private
if for all X ,Y satisfying d(X ,Y) = 1 and all sets S of possible outputs the following holds:
Pr[A(X ) ∈ S] ≤ eε Pr[A(Y) ∈ S] + δ. (4)
In addition, if δ = 0 then the algorithm A is ε-differentially private.
In our setting, the distance d(·, ·) between two datasets X and Y is defined as the number of different
columns in X and Y. Differential privacy ensures the output distribution is obfuscated to the point
that every user has a plausible deniability about being in the dataset, and in addition any inferences
about individual user will have nearly the same confidence before and after the private release.
3 Sample-aggregation based private subspace clustering
In this section we first summarize the sample-aggregate framework introduced in [22] and argue
why it should be preferred to conventional output perturbation mechanisms [7, 8] for subspace clus-
tering. We then analyze two efficient algorithms based on the sample-aggregate framework and
prove formal privacy and utility guarantees. We also prove new results in our analysis regarding
the stability of k-means subspace clustering (Lem. 3.3) and graph connectivity (i.e., consistency) of
noisy threshold-based subspace clustering (TSC, [14]) under a stochastic model (Lem. 3.5).
3.1 Smooth local sensitivity and the sample-aggregate framework
Figure 1: Illustration of instability of k-means
subspace clustering solutions (d = 2, k = 2, q =
1). Blue dots represent evenly spaced data points
on the unit circle; blue crosses indicate an addi-
tional data point. Red lines are optimal solutions.
Most existing privacy frameworks [7, 8] are
based on the idea of global sensitivity, which
is defined as the maximum output perturbation
‖f(X1) − f(X2)‖ξ, where maximum is over
all neighboring databases X1,X2 and ξ = 1 or
2. Unfortunately, global sensitivity of cluster-
ing problems is usually high even if only clus-
ter centers are released. For example, Figure
1 shows that the global sensitivity of k-means
subspace clustering could be as high as O(1),
which ruins the algorithm utility.
To circumvent the above-mentioned chal-
lenges, Nissim et al. [22] introduces the
sample-aggregate framework based on the con-
cept of a smooth version of local sensitivity.
Unlike global sensitivity, local sensitivity measures the maximum perturbation ‖f(X ) − f(X ′)‖ξ
over all databases X ′ neighboring to the input database X . The proposed sample-aggregate frame-
work (pseudocode in Alg. 1) enjoys local sensitivity and comes with the following guarantee:
Theorem 3.1 ([22], Theorem 4.2). Let f : D → RD be an efficiently computable function where
D is the collection of all databases and D is the output dimension. Let dM(·, ·) be a semimetric on
3
the outer space of f . 1 Set ε > 2D/
√
m and m = ω(log2 n). The sample-aggregate algorithm
A in Algorithm 1 is an efficient (ε, δ)-differentially private algorithm. Furthermore, if f and m are
chosen such that the `1 norm of the output of f is bounded by Λ and
Pr
XS⊆X
[dM(f(XS), c) ≤ r] ≥
3
4
(5)
for some c ∈ RD and r > 0, then the standard deviation of Gaussian noise added is upper bounded
by O(r/ε) + Λε e
−Ω( ε
√
m
D ). In addition, when m satisfies m = ω(D2 log2(r/Λ)/ε2), with high
probability each coordinate ofA(X )− c̄ is upper bounded by O(r/ε), where c̄ depending onA(X )
satisfies dM(c, c̄) = O(r).
Let f be any subspace clustering solver that outputs k estimated low-dimensional subspaces and
dM be the Wasserstein’s distance as defined in Eq. (2). Theorem 3.1 provides privacy guarantee
for an efficient meta-algorithm with any f . In addition, utility guarantee holds with some more
assumptions on input dataset X . In following sections we establish utility guarantees. The main
idea is to prove stability results as outlined in Eq. (5) for particular subspace clustering solvers and
then apply Theorem 3.1.
3.2 The agnostic setting
We first consider the setting when data points {xi}ni=1 are arbitrarily placed. Under such agnostic
setting the optimal solution C∗ is defined as the one that minimizes the k-means cost as in Eq. (3).
The solver f is taken to be any (1 + )-approximation2 of optimal k-means subspace clustering; that
is, f always outputs subspaces Ĉ satisfying cost(Ĉ;X ) ≤ (1 + )cost(C∗;X ). Efficient core-set
based approximation algorithms exist, for example, in [12]. The key task of this section it to identify
assumptions under which the stability condition in Eq. (5) holds with respect to an approximate
solver f . The example given in Figure 1 also suggests that identifiability issue arises when the input
data X itself cannot be well clustered. For example, no two straight lines could well approximate
data uniformly distributed on a circle. To circumvent the above-mentioned difficulty, we impose the
following well-separation condition on the input data X :
Definition 3.2 (Well-separation condition for k-means subspace clustering). A dataset X is
(φ, η, ψ)-well separated if there exist constants φ, η and ψ, all between 0 and 1, such that
∆2k(X ) ≤ min
{
φ2∆2k−1(X ),∆2k,−(X )− ψ,∆2k,+(X ) + η
}
, (6)
where ∆k−1, ∆k,− and ∆k,+ are defined as ∆2k−1(X ) = minS1:k−1∈Sdq cost({Si};X ); ∆
2
k,−(X ) =
minS1∈Sdq−1,S2:k∈Sdq cost({Si};X ); and ∆
2
k,+(X ) = minS1∈Sdq+1,S2:k∈Sdq cost({Si};X ).
The first condition in Eq. (6), ∆2k(X ) ≤ φ2∆2k−1(X ), constrains that the input dataset X cannot
be well clustered using k − 1 instead of k clusters. It was introduced in [23] to analyze stability of
k-means solutions. For subspace clustering, we need another two conditions regarding the intrinsic
dimension of each subspace. The ∆2k(X ) ≤ ∆2k,−(X ) − ψ asserts that replacing a q-dimensional
subspace with a (q − 1)-dimensional one is not sufficient, while ∆2k(X ) ≤ ∆2k,+(X ) + η means an
additional subspace dimension does not help much with clustering X .
The following lemma is our main stability result for subspace clustering on well-separated datasets.
It states that when a candidate clustering Ĉ is close to the optimal clustering C∗ in terms of clustering
cost, they are also close in terms of the Wasserstein distance defined in Eq. (2).
Lemma 3.3 (Stability of agnostic k-means subspace clustering). Assume X is (φ, η, ψ)-well sepa-
rated with φ2 < 1/1602, ψ > η. Suppose a candidate clustering Ĉ = {Ŝ1, · · · , Ŝk} ⊆ Sdq satisfies
cost(Ĉ;X ) ≤ a · cost(C∗;X ) for some a < 1−802φ

dW (Ĉ, C∗) ≤
600
√
2φ2
√
k
(1− 150φ2)(ψ − η)
. (7)
The following theorem is then a simple corollary, with a complete proof in Appendix B.
1dM(·, ·) satisfies dM(x, y) ≥ 0, dM(x, x) = 0 and dM(x, y) ≤ dM(x, z) + dM(y, z) for all x, y, z.
2Here  is an approximation constant and is not related to the privacy parameter ε.

Algorithm 2 Threshold-based subspace clustering (TSC), a simplified version
1: Input: X = {xi}ni=1 ⊆ Rd, number of clusters k and number of neighbors s.
2: Thresholding: construct G ∈ {0, 1}n×n by connecting xi to the other s data points in X with
the largest absolute inner products |〈xi,x′〉|. Complete G so that it is undirected.
3: Clustering: Let X (1), · · · ,X (`) be the connected components in G. Construct X̄ (`) by sam-
pling q points from X (`) uniformly at random without replacement.
4: Output: subspaces Ĉ = {Ŝ(`)}k`=1; Ŝ(`) is the subspace spanned by q arbitrary points in X̄ (`).
Theorem 3.4. Fix a (φ, η, ψ)-well separated dataset X with n data points and φ2 < 1/1602,
ψ > η. Suppose XS ⊆ X is a subset of X with size m, sampled uniformly at random without
replacement. Let Ĉ = {Ŝ1, · · · , Ŝ2} be an (1 + )-approximation of optimal k-means subspace
clustering computed on XS . If m = Ω(kqd log(qd/γ
′∆2k(X ))
γ′2∆4k(X )
) with γ′ < 1−802φ
2
800φ2 − 2(1 + ), then we
have:

, (8)
where C∗ = {S∗1 , · · · ,S∗k} is the optimal clustering on X ; that is, cost(C∗;X ) = ∆2k(X ).
Consequently, applying Theorem 3.4 together with the sample-aggregate framework we obtain a
weak polynomial-time ε-differentially private algorithm for agnostic k-means subspace clustering,
with additional amount of per-coordinate Gaussian noise upper bounded by O( φ
2
√
k
ε(ψ−η) ). Our bound
is comparable to the one obtained in [22] for private k-means clustering, except for the (ψ−η) term
which characterizes the well-separatedness under the subspace clustering scenario.
3.3 The stochastic setting
We further consider the case when data points are stochastically generated from some underlying
“true” subspace set C∗ = {S∗1 , · · · ,S∗k}. Such settings were extensively investigated in previous
development of subspace clustering algorithms [24, 25, 14]. Below we give precise definition of the
considered stochastic subspace clustering model:
The stochastic model For every cluster ` associated with subspace S∗` , a data point x
(`)
i ∈ Rd
belonging to cluster ` can be written as x(`)i = y
(`)
i + ε
(`)
i , where y
(`)
i is sampled uniformly at
random from {y ∈ S∗` : ‖y‖2 = 1} and εi ∼ N (0, σ2/d · Id) for some noise parameter σ.
Under the stochastic setting we consider the solver f to be the Threshold-based Subspace Clustering
(TSC, [14]) algorithm. A simplified version of TSC is presented in Alg. 2. An alternative idea is to
apply results in the previous section since the stochastic model implies well-separated dataset when
noise level σ is small. However, the running time of TSC is O(n2d), which is much more efficient
than core-set based methods. TSC is provably correct in that the similarity graph G has no false
connections and is connected per cluster, as shown in the following lemma:
Lemma 3.5 (Connectivity of TSC). Fix γ > 1 and assume max 0.04n` ≤ s ≤ minn`/6. If for

Complete proofs are deferred to Appendix C.

Theorem 3.6 (Stability of TSC on stochastic data). Assume conditions in Lemma 3.5 hold with
respect to n′ = n/m for ω(log2 n) ≤ m ≤ o(n). Assume in addition that limn→∞ n` = ∞ for all

Compared to Theorem 3.4 for the agnostic model, Theorem 3.6 shows that one can achieve consis-
tent estimation of underlying subspaces under a stochastic model. It is an interesting question to
derive finite sample bounds for the differentially private TSC algorithm.
3.4 Discussion
It is worth noting that the sample-aggregate framework is an (ε, δ)-differentially private mechanism
for any computational subroutine f . However, the utility claim (i.e., the O(r/ε) bound on each
coordinate of A(X ) − c) requires the stability of the particular subroutine f , as outlined in Eq.
(5). It is unfortunately hard to theoretically argue for stability of state-of-the-art subspace clustering
methods such as sparse subspace cluster (SSC, [11]) due to the “graph connectivity” issue [21]3.
Nevertheless, we observe satisfactory performance of SSC based algorithms in simulations (see
Sec. 5). It remains an open question to derive utility guarantee for (user) differentially private SSC.
4 Private subspace clustering via the exponential mechanism
In Section 3 we analyzed two algorithms with provable privacy and utility guarantees for sub-
space clustering based on the sample-aggregate framework. However, empirical evidence shows
that sample-aggregate based private clustering suffers from poor utility in practice [26]. In this sec-
tion, we propose a practical private subspace clustering algorithm based on the exponential mecha-
nism [18]. In particular, given the dataset X with n data points, we propose to samples parameters
θ = ({S`}k`=1, {zi}ni=1) where S` ∈ S
q
d, zj ∈ {1, · · · , k} from the following distribution:
p(θ;X ) ∝ exp
(
−ε
2
·
n∑
i=1
d2(xi,Szi)
)
, (10)
where ε > 0 is the privacy parameter. The following proposition shows that exact sampling from
the distribution in Eq. (10) results in a provable differentially private algorithm. Its proof is trivial
and is deferred to Appendix D.1. Note that unlike sample-aggregate based methods, the exponential
mechanism can privately release clustering assignment z. This does not violate the lower bound in
[29] because the released clustering assignment z is not guaranteed to be exactly correct.
Proposition 4.1. The random algorithm A : X 7→ θ that outputs one sample from the distribution
defined in Eq. (10) is ε-differential private.
4.1 A Gibbs sampling implementation
It is hard in general to sample parameters from distributions as complicated as in Eq. (10). We
present a Gibbs sampler that iteratively samples subspaces {Si} and cluster assignments {zj} from
their conditional distributions.
Update of zi: When {S`} and z−i are fixed, the conditional distribution of zi is
p(zi|{S`}k`=1, z−i;X ) ∝ exp(−ε/2 · d2(xi,Szi)). (11)
Since d(xi,Szi) can be efficiently computed (given an orthonormal basis of Szi ), update of zi can
be easily done by sampling zj from a categorical distribution.
Update of S`: Let X̃ (`) = {xi ∈ X : zi = `} denote data points that are assigned to cluster ` and
ñ` = |X̃ (`)|. Denote X̃(`) ∈ Rd×ñ` as the matrix with columns corresponding to all data points in
X̃ (`). The distribution over S` conditioned on z can then be written as
p(S` = range(U`)|z;X ) ∝ exp(ε/2 · tr(U>` A`U`)); U` ∈ Rd×q,U>` U` = Iq×q, (12)
where A` = X̃(`)X̃(`)
>
is the unnormalized sample covariance matrix. Distribution of the form in
Eq. (12) is a special case of the matrix Bingham distribution, which admits a Gibbs sampler [16]. We
give implementation details in Appendix D.2 with modifications so that the resulting Gibbs sampler
is empirically more efficient for a wide range of parameter settings.
3Recently [28] established full clustering guarantee for SSC, however, under strong assumptions.

4.2 Discussion
The proposed Gibbs sampler resembles the k-plane algorithm for subspace clustering [3]. It is
in fact a “probabilistic” version of k-plane since sampling is performed at each iteration rather
than deterministic updates. Furthermore, the proposed Gibbs sampler could be viewed as posterior
sampling for the following generative model: first sample U` uniformly at random from Sdq for
each subspace S`; afterwards, cluster assignments {zi}ni=1 are sampled such that Pr[zi = j] = 1/k
and xi is set as xi = U`yi + PU⊥` wi, where yi is sampled uniformly at random from the q-
dimensional unit ball and wi ∼ N (0, Id/ε). Connection between the above-mentioned generative
model and Gibbs sampler is formally justified in Appendix D.3. The generative model is strikingly
similar to the well-known mixtures of probabilistic PCA (MPPCA, [27]) model by setting variance
parameters σ` in MPPCA to
√
1/ε. The only difference is that yi are sampled uniformly at random
from a unit ball 4 and noisewi is constrained to U⊥` , the complement space of U`. Note that this is
closely related to earlier observation that “posterior sampling is private” [20, 6, 31], but different in
that we constructed a model from a private procedure rather than the other way round.
As the privacy parameter ε → ∞ (i.e., no privacy guarantee), we arrive immediately at the exact
k-plane algorithm and the posterior distribution concentrates around the optimal k-means solution
(C∗, z∗). This behavior is similar to what a small-variance asymptotic analysis on MPPCA models
reveals [30]. On the other hand, the proposed Gibbs sampler is significantly different from previous
Bayesian probabilisitic PCA formulation [34, 30] in that the subspaces are sampled from a matrix
Bingham distribution. Finally, we remark that the proposed Gibbs sampler is only asymptotically
private because Proposition 4.1 requires exact (or nearly exact [31]) sampling from Eq. (10).
5 Numerical results
We provide numerical results of both the sample-aggregate and Gibbs sampling algorithms on syn-
thetic and real-world datasets. We also compare with a baseline method implemented based on the
k-plane algorithm [3] with perturbed sample covariance matrix via the SuLQ framework [2] (de-
tails presented in Appendix E). Three solvers are considered for the sample-aggregate framework:
threshold-based subspace clustering (TSC, [14]), which has provable utility guarantee with sample-
aggregation on stochastic models, along with sparse subspace clustering (SSC, [11]) and low-rank
representation (LRR, [17]), the two state-of-the-art methods for subspace clustering. For Gibbs
sampling, we use non-private SSC and LRR solutions as initialization for the Gibbs sampler. All
methods are implemented using Matlab.
For synthetic datasets, we first generate k random q-dimensional linear subspaces. Each subspace is
generated by first sampling a d× q random Gaussian matrix and then recording its column space. n
data points are then assigned to one of the k subspaces (clusters) uniformly at random. To generate
a data point xi assigned with subspace S`, we first sample yi ∈ Rq with ‖yi‖2 = 1 uniformly
at random from the q-dimensional unit sphere. Afterwards, xi is set as xi = U`yi + wi, where
U` ∈ Rd×q is an orthonormal basis associated with S` and wi ∼ N (0, σ2Id) is a noise vector.
Figure 2 compares the utility (measured in terms of k-means objective cost(Ĉ;X ) and the Wasser-
stein’s distance dW (Ĉ, C∗)) of sample aggregation, Gibbs sampling and SuLQ subspace clustering.
As shown in the plots, sample-aggregation algorithms have poor utility unless the privacy parameter
ε is truly large (which means very little privacy protection). On the other hand, both Gibbs sampling
and SuLQ subspace clustering give reasonably good performance. Figure 2 also shows that SuLQ
scales poorly with the ambient dimension d. This is because SuLQ subspace clustering requires
calibrating noise to a d × d sample covariance matrix, which induces much error when d is large.
Gibbs sampling seems to be robust to various d settings.
We also experiment on real-world datasets. The right two plots in Figure 2 report utility on a sub-
set of the extended Yale Face Dataset B [13] for face clustering. 5 random individuals are picked,
forming a subset of the original dataset with n = 320 data points (images). The dataset is prepro-
cessed by projecting each individual onto a 9D affine subspace via PCA. Such preprocessing step
was adopted in [32, 29] and was theoretically justified in [1]. Afterwards, ambient dimension of
the entire dataset is reduced to d = 50 by random Gaussian projection. The plots show that Gibbs
sampling significantly outperforms the other algorithms.

Figure 3: Test statistics, k-means cost and dW (Ĉ, C∗) of 8 trials of the Gibbs sampler under different
privacy settings. Synthetic dataset setting: n = 1000, d = 10, k = 3, q = 3, σ = 0.1.
In Figure 3 we investigate the mixing behavior of proposed Gibbs sampler. We plot for multiple
trials of Gibbs sampling the k-means objective, Wasserstein’s distance and a test statistic 1/

statistic has mean zero under distribution in Eq. (10) and a similar statistic was used in [4] as a
diagnostic of the mixing behavior of another Gibbs sampler. Figure 3 shows that under various
privacy parameter settings, the proposed Gibbs sampler mixes quite well after 10000 iterations.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we consider subspace clustering subject to formal differential privacy constraints. We
analyzed two sample-aggregate based algorithms with provable utility guarantees under agnostic and
stochastic data models. We also propose a Gibbs sampling subspace clustering algorithm based on
the exponential mechanism that works well in practice. Some interesting future directions include
utility bounds for state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms like SSC or LRR.
